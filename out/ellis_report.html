We are experiencing a crisis in the African American community in San Francisco, 
particularly among African American males.  As we prepare to celebrate the Martin Luther 
King holiday this weekend, what can we as a city do to focus on this population and help 
them thrive? (Supervisor Breed, District 5)

3. For every Ellis Act eviction that takes place in San Francisco, we know that many other
tenants have been displaced from their homes after accepting a monetary offer, often 
called "buy-outs" from their landlord. There are currently no municipal regulations of these 
buy-outs that lead to the significant reduction of rent controlled units in our City. Will you 
commit to working with me on legislation addre</p><h4>San Francisco Board of Supervisors</h4><p>2014-01-07 00:00:00</p><p>olution to go
