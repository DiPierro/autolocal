A. 
parcels consisting of approximately 4.7 acres into twenty-one (21) parcels consisting of one 0.25 
acre parcel for a detention basin and twenty (20) parcels for a residential housing development

1. 

Receive staff report 

Staff report —Donna Decker reviewed the staff report and plans as submitted to 
Commission. She explained the differences in previous plans (originally submitted 
in 1993) and changes since the first submittal of the map. She explained the 
applicant is proposing a 21-parcel single-family residential subdivision on three 
parcels (4.7 acre). The proposed subdivision was initially proposed and approved in 
1993 and 2005; both maps expired. The applicant is submitting a similar proposal 
as previously approved with slight differences in lot sizes, the connection to 
Bridgeford Avenue for future growth to the north. The tentative subdivision map 
will create 20 new single-family lots ranging in size from 5, 050 to 6,565 square feet 
and one lot reserved for a storm water detention basin 11,200 square feet. She 
elaborated as to revised zoning codes and purpose to support infill design and 
legalize small parcels in town. She explained the City reduced lot sized and allowed 
for smaller lot designations under R1 zoning. She reviewed exhibit "A" Conditions of 
Approval and map as well as discussing the variety of zones and lot sizes within the 
map, proposed sidewalk improvements and deferred improvements as well as 
standards that need to be made for this subdivision. She closed that this is an 
opportunity for Commission to make recommendations to bring to City Council of 
this project. The project is categorically exempt and no environmental impacts. 

Chairwoman Espino and Vice Chairman Wolfe asked for clarification of deferred 
sidewalk improvements. Decker reported it was for curb and gutter (north to south 
areas of the project with landscaping only). Espino and Wolfe both expressed 
concerns with conditions relating to the City entering into a deferred agreement 
relating to improvements located on the east one-half of West Biggs Gridley Road 
and costs associated to the improvements be passed onto the future property 
owners of those parcels. They both elaborated as to when other subdivisions have 
built along West Biggs Gridley Road, the improvements were included. 

Commissioner Khan inquired if there are issues with archeological artifacts. Decker 
explained if found, the contractor is required to stop and inform the City and the 
owner will need to have an archeologist come out to the site. Decker reviewed the 
process of approval of the map and responsible parties for the project and 
development. Khan inquired what the term "slope" meant on the property map. 
Decker explained it's part of the drainage information for the lots. The grading plans 
and improvement plans will be further submitted. 

Chairwoman Espino inquired on the Bridgeford Ave proposed future street 
extension. Decker reviewed the future street extension (county) plan submittal and 
designation. She explained the future street extension on Bridgeford, required 
annexation due to county lines. The original proposal was not to have Glen Drive 
but due to safety personnel access concerns, this plan has been submitted. 

Espino inquired about #11 condition. Decker explained it is to keeping the dust 
down for Butte County Air Quality. There was further discussion between Decker 
and Espino relating to the City providing the same type of maintenance of districts 
such as those of Heron Landing. Decker concurred and explained the process of the 
deed lot 21, detentions, landscaping and streetlights, as well as frontage 
improvements. 

Commissioner Khan inquired if the building requirements included building to code 
for "earthquakes" criteria. Decker reported that they will need to meet the most 
current uniform building codes which include that criteria. 

2. 

Open the pubic hearing —Chairwoman Espino opened the public hearing. 

Curt Hilburs — 1555 Atkinson Court, Yuba City, owner of Hilburs Inc. introduced 
himself to the Commission. He explained there is a lot of interest to build especially 
after CampFire Disaster and would like to see the project built. The difference 
between them and other builders is that the project this is a much smaller project. 
Chairwoman Espino ask about project timelines. Mr. Hilburs explained they are 
working on a smaller project in Gridley, so it would be fast and they anticipate to be 
under construction this summer. They have much larger projects in other cities, this 
is a small project and it would move fast. There was discussion between 
Chairwoman Espino and Vice Chairman Wolfe relating to the deferred development 
of improvements and if the new owners would be made aware ahead oftime before 
purchasing the project of those assessments. There was concern expressed of 
passing on the costs of the improvement to new homeowners. 

Decker explained the owners would be notified of deferred improvement costs. It is 
best to design the entire road vs a short entire section of the road. She explained 
the theory for deferring improvements to ensure design conformity. Wolfe 
expressed concern of future costs for improvements could change over time. 
Decker explained control points and improvements and elaborated as to designing 
of small sections, pockets done if not right there could be problems with funding to 
tear out and rebuild improvements. There would be disclosures provided to owners 
and options to setup an assessment district. 

Commissioner Khan ask Hilburs to confirm the other areas of improvements, lift 
station and retention basin. Hilburs confirmed per City Engineer and City 
requirements would have to be completed before homes are sold and all 
improvements should be in place and to code and prior to sale of homes. 

Pat Coghlan — 852 Idaho Street, addressed the Commission and asked the 
Commission to reconsider the allowance of deferred improvements. The deferment 
of improvements only provides savings of costs to the developer. It puts the burden 
on new homeowners, the City and/or County. He reported that all other builders 
have provided improvement upfront and allowing deferment of improvements 
makes the future property owners jump through hoops take on the burden that 
should be on the developer. He urged the Commission to reconsider. He added that 
that the detention pond calls for 6 ft cyclone fence with flats, that will look very 
unattractive. His primary concern was the safety issues with the plot plan. He 

deferred to other areas that are unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. He suggested 
have a safety engineer look at the plot plan because it is not safe and the City do not 
allow deferred improvements on West Biggs Gridley Road. 

There was brief overview of the map reassessing safety for pedestrians and cyclists. 
Decker reported if upon building the detention pond it is deep that would require 
fencing the instead of the cyclone fence it could be changed to an iron fence around 
Lot 21 detention basin with shrubbery. 

Close Public Hearing - Chairwoman Espino closed the public hearing. 

Commission Discussion -

4. 

Chairwoman Espino announced that new housing good idea for Gridley and Heron 
Landing Development has already set a standard to have improvements in place 
prior to the sale of homes. There will be more traffic and safety is a huge issue and 
she was not in support of the deferment of roadside improvements. She concluded 
she was in support of the development however, not the deferment of 
improvements along West Biggs Gridley Road as well as the extension to Bridgeford 
Street. 

Commissioner Khan announced she appreciated the interest in developing ín 
Gridley but the sidewalk improvements should in place prior to the building of the 
development or if there is a deferment there should be a plan for deferred costs for 
future owners. There needs to be clarification for costs for proposal of deferred 
amounts to homeowners such as annual tax assessments. 

Vice Chairman Wolfe expressed concern with deferment of improvements along 
West Biggs Gridley Road. He was in support of new housing but not deferring costs 
to homeowners. 

Planning Consultant, Donna Decker suggested adding language to fencing 
conditions to the detention basin and deferment and cost plans. She explained the 
assessment process and plans. 

MOTION  BY ESPINO, for the following: 

Determine the project is Categorically Exempt per the California 
Environmental Quality Act, Section 15332(a-e), Class 32, Infill Development 
Projects; and, 
Recommend approval of TSM 1-19 to the City Council with added two 
conditions of approval; if the detention basin requires fencing, it will not be 
cyclone fence, it will be iron/steel tubular fencing with shrubbery and the 
improvements along West Biggs Gridley Road and the Bridgford extension 
not be deferred. 

For a lack of a second, motion did not pass. 

Vice Chairman provided clarification that the Bridgford extension is County and is 
not included within the improvement limits of the project. He further 
elaborated that he did not agree with deferring of improvements.

6,146 square feet in size (0.14 
acre) and has setbacks on the 
streetside of twenty feet (Heron 
Landing Way, twenty feet for 
the front yard setback 
(Canvasback Court) a minimum 
of five feet at the interior 
sideyard, and a minimum of five 
feet at the rear yard setback 
area. The rear yard is "notched" 
for the City generator system on 
the east side of the lot.

Discussion 
Background 
The parcel is one of seventeen parcels that remained to be developed. Mr. Sandeep 
Dhami purchased the parcels and requested guidance for the completion of the lots 
with single family homes. The City and Mr. Dhami conducted several meetings both in 
person and via telephone conferences to develop the site more economically and 
independent of the housing types that had been approved. The City worked with Mr. 
Dhami and reviewed what the home type would need to be and how they fit within the 
required setbacks. 

Mr. Dhami presented several models that could be used on any of the sites thus 
"masterplanning" the final construction to reduce potential additional costs. These 
were reviewed and accepted as viable substitutions for the proposed lot development. 

Land Use 
The project site is zoned R-1, Single Family Residential District with a General Plan land use 
designation of Residential, Low Density.  The single-family residential district now has four (4) 
designations: 

1.  R-1A  Parcels sized from 1,700 — 3,500 square feet 
2.  R-1B  Parcels sized from 3,501— 5,999 square feet 
3.  R1-C  Parcels sized from 6,000 — 7,499 square feet 
4.  R-1 

Parcels sized from 7,500 and greater 

The parcel is considered R-1C. This designation does not reduce the setback requirements from 
the R-1 district. 

Setback Requirements 
The setback requirements for a corner lot are 20% of the frontage distance with a minimum of 
5' on the interior boundary and 20' on the street side. The site is approximately 67 feet wide. 
Generally, the setback required would be approximately 13.4 feet for an interior lot. The 
requirement to have 20 feet and five feet realizes 42 feet available for the width of a new 
home. 

Front Yard: 
Interior Side Yard: 
Rear Yard: 
Street Side: 

20' 
5' 
5' 
20' 

The proposed structure is 45' in width. This allows only a 17' street side setback. Although the 
applicant is requesting a reduction to 17', it is appropriate to reduce it to 15' to allow some 
room for placement during construction. 

The irregular lot shape and desire to maximize the rear yard area limits the depth of the design 
to meet setback standards.

Proposed Project 
The applicant proposes to construct a single story residential unit with a building footprint of 
2,048 square feet. This equals a lot coverage of 33%meeting the development standards. The 
size of structure is compatible with the surrounding area. The resulting reduction will not have 
a visual impact to the subdivision and does not significantly encroach into the setback area.

Findings: 
Variances are entitlements that are supported when there are site constraints that preclude 
any other solution to meet the code. The applicant has stated that due to the irregular shape 
of the lot, it is not possible to design a home in keeping with others in the neighborhood. 
Should the commission believe that the variance can be supported it will need to make the 
following findings and describe how these have been met: 

Page 4 of 8 

Variance Findings (17.09.030) 

A.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, 
or building involved and which are not applicable to lands, structures or buildings in the 
same district. 

(What are the special site conditions and circumstances that are peculiar to the site and not 
evident at other residential sites within the same district?J 

B.  That literal application of the provisions of this title would deprive the applicant of rights 
commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this title. 

(How does the application of the requirement deprive the applicant to enjoy their property 
that others enjoy?) 

C. That the granting of such application will not, under the circumstances of the particular 

case materially affect adversely the health or safety of persons residing or working in the 
neighborhood of the property of the applicant, and will not under the circumstances of 
the particular case, be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to 
property or improvements in said neighborhood. 

(How does granting the variance affect the neighborhood? Does the granting of the 
variance impact the neighborhood?J 

Recommendation:

Variance Findings 

Exhibit A 

A.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, 
or building involved and which are not applicable to lands, structures or buildings in the 
same district; 

Special conditions exist that support the reduced street side setback in that the lot is an 
irregular shape and the subdivision was designed with minimal area for an owner to enjoy a 
reasonable rear yard private area. 

B.  That literal application of the provisions of this title would deprive, the applicant of rights 
commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this title; 

The literal application of the development standards would deprive this property of the 
same rights that others enjoy with similar conditions of their property. 

C.  That the granting of such application will not, under the circumstances of the particular 

case materially affect adversely the health or safety of persons residing or working in the 
neighborhood of the property of the applicant, and will not under the circumstances of 
the particular case, be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to 
property or improvements in said neighborhood. 

Allowing the property owner the planning entitlement to reduce the street side setback will 
not adversely impact the health or safety of ensure the health and safety of persons 
residing adjacent to and proximate to the site and will not be detrimental to the public 
welfare or injuruiouse to property or improvements in the neighborhood.

Discussion 

Background  
The parcel is one of seventeen parcels that remained to be developed. Mr. Sandeep 
Dhami purchased the parcels and requested guidance for the completion of the lots 
with single family homes. The City and Mr. Dhami conducted several meetings both in 
person and via telephone conferences to develop the site more economically and 
independent of the housing types that had been approved. The City worked with Mr. 
Dhami and reviewed what the home type would need to be and how they fit within the 
required setbacks. 

Mr. Dhami presented several models that could be used on any of the sites thus 
"masterplanning" the final construction to reduce potential additional costs. These 
were reviewed and accepted as viable substitutions for the proposed lot development. 

I and LISP 
The project site is zoned R-1, Single Family Residential District with a General Plan land use 
designation of Residential, Low Density. The single-family residential district now has four (4) 
designations: 

1.  R-1A Parcels sized from 1,700 — 3,500 square feet 
2.  R-1B Parcels sized from 3,501— 5,999 square feet 
3.  R1-C Parcels sized from 6,000 — 7,499 square feet 
4.  R-1 

Parcels sized from 7,500 and greater 

The parcel is considered R-1C. This designation does not reduce the setback requirements from 
the R-1 district. 

Setback Requirements 
The setback requirements for a corner lot are 20% of the frontage distance with a minimum of 
5' on the interior boundary and 20' on the street side. The site is approximately 64.6 feet wide. 
Generally, the setback required would be approximately 12.9 feet for an interior lot. The 
requirement to have 20 feet and five feet realizes 39.5 feet available for the width of a new 
home. 

Front Yard: 
Interior Side Yard: 
Rear Yard: 
Street Side: 

20' 
5' 
5' 
20' 

The proposed structure is 43' in width. This allows only an 18' street side setback. Although 
the applicant is requesting a reduction to 18', it is appropriate to reduce it to 15' to allow some 
room for placement during construction.

Proposed Project 
The applicant proposes to construct a single story residential unit with a building footprint of 
1,809 square feet. This equals a lot coverage of 25% meeting the development standards. The 
size of structure is compatible with the surrounding area. The resulting reduction will not have 
a visual impact to the subdivision and does not significantly encroach into the setback area.

Findings: 
Variances are entitlements that are supported when there are site constraints that preclude 
any other solution to meet the code. The applicant has stated that due to the irregular shape 
of the lot, it is not possible to design a home in keeping with others in the neighborhood. 
Should the commission believe that the variance can be supported it will need to make the 
following findings and describe how these have been met: 

Variance Findings (17.09.030) 

A. That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, 
or building involved and which are not applicable to lands, structures or buildings in the 
same district. 

Page 4 of 8 

(What are the special site conditions and circumstances that are peculiar to the site and not 
evident at other residential sites within the same district?J 

B.  That literal application of the provisions of this title would deprive the applicant of rights 
commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this title. 

(How does the application of the requirement deprive the applicant to enjoy their property 
that others enjoy?J 

C.  That the granting of such application will not, under the circumstances of the particular 

case materially affect adversely the health or safety of persons residing or working in the 
neighborhood of the property of the applicant, and will not under the circumstances of 
the particular case, be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to 
property or improvements in said neighborhood. 

(How does granting the variance affect the neighborhood? Does the granting of the 
variance impact the neighborhood?) 

Recommendation:

Discussion 
Background 
The parcel is one of seventeen parcels that remained to be developed. Mr. Sandeep 
Dhami purchased the parcels and requested guidance for the completion of the lots 
with single family homes. The City and Mr. Dhami conducted several meetings both in 
person and via telephone conferences to develop the site more economically and 
independent of the housing types that had been approved. The City worked with Mr. 
Dhami and reviewed what the home type would need to be and how they fit within the 
required setbacks. 

Mr. Dhami presented several models that could be used on any of the sites thus 
"masterplanning" the final construction to reduce potential additional costs. These 
were reviewed and accepted as viable substitutions for the proposed lot development. 

Land Use 
The project site is zoned R-1, Single Family Residential District with a General Plan land use 
designation of Residential, Low Density. The single-family residential district now has four (4) 
designations: 

1.  R-1A Parcels sized from 1,700 — 3,500 square feet 
2.  R-1B Parcels sized from 3,501— 5,999 square feet 
3.  R1-C Parcels sized from 6,000 — 7,499 square feet 
4.  R-1 

Parcels sized from 7,500 and greater 

The parcel is considered R-1C. This designation does not reduce the setback requirements from 
the R-1 district. 

Setback Requirements 
The setback requirements for a corner lot are 20% of the frontage distance with a minimum of 
5' on the interior boundary and 20' on the street side. The site is approximately 67 feet wide. 
Generally, the setback required would be approximately 13.4 feet for an interior lot. The 
requirement to have 20 feet and five feet realizes 42 feet available for the width of a new 
home. 

Front Yard: 
Interior Side Yard: 
Rear Yard: 
Street Side: 

20' 
5' 
5' 
20' 

The proposed structure is 45' in width. This allows only an 17' street side setback. Although 
the applicant is requesting a reduction to 17', it is appropriate to reduce it to 15' to allow some 
room for placement during construction.

Findings: 
Variances are entitlements that are supported when there are site constraints that preclude 
any other solution to meet the code. The applicant has stated that due to the irregular shape 
of the lot, it is not possible to design a home in keeping with others in the neighborhood. 
Should the commission believe that the variance can be supported it will need to make the 
following findings and describe how these have been met: 

Variance Findings (17.09.030) 

A. That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, 
or building involved and which are not applicable to lands, structures or buildings in the 
same district. 

Page 4 of 8 

(What are the special site conditions and circumstances that are peculiar to the site and not 
evident at other residential sites within the same district?) 

B.  That literal application of the provisions of this title would deprive the applicant of rights 
commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this title. 

(How does the application of the requirement deprive the applicant to enjoy their property 
that others enjoy?) 

C.  That the granting of such application will not, under the circumstances of the particular 

case materially affect adversely the health or safety of persons residing or working in the 
neighborhood of the property of the applicant, and will not under the circumstances of 
the particular case, be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to 
property or improvements in said neighborhood. 

(How does granting the variance affect the neighborhood? Does the granting of the 
variance impact the neighborhood?J

Subject: 

Variance No. 4-19;  Application for a variance from Title 17 zoning code 
development standards to reduce the side yard setback from 20 to 15 feet 
located at 1905 Grey Lodge Ct in the Single Family Residential District (R-1) and 
Residential, Low Density (RLD) General Plan land use designation. 
(APN: 009-250-064) 

Recommendation 
City staff respectfully recommends the Planning Commission: 

1.  Determine the project is Categorically Exempt per the California Environmental 

Quality Act, Section 15305 (a), Class 5, Minor Alterations in Land Use Limitations; 
and, 

2.  Make the required variance findings as described within Exhibit A allowing the 

reduced streetside setback from 20 feet to 15 feet; and, 

3.  Approve Variance No. 04-19 with Conditions of Approval as shown in Exhibit B. 

Summary 
The applicant is requesting a variance from the development standards to reduce the 
side yard setback on the street side of a corner lot from twenty feet to ten feet. The 
proposed site plan depicts a reduction to seventeen feet, staff is recommending fifteen 
feet to ensure the construction can stay within that limit. 

n:a., 

Site Description 
The subject site is located in the Heron Landing Subdivision. It is a corner lot located on the 
northwest corner of Heron Landing Way and Cinnamon Teal Court. The lot is approximately 
7,504 square feet in size (0.17 
acre) and has setbacks on the 
streetside of twenty feet (Heron 
Landing Way, twenty feet for 
the front yard setback (Grey 
Lodge Ct) a minimum of five feet 
at the interior sideyard, and a 
minimum of five feet at the rear 
yard setback area. The site is 
narrower at the rear than the 
front. 

Vicinity Map 

Discussion 
Background  
The parcel is one of seventeen parcels that remained to be developed. Mr. Sandeep 
Dhami purchased the parcels and requested guidance for the completion of the lots 
with single family homes. The City and Mr. Dhami conducted several meetings both in 
person and via telephone conferences to develop the site more economically and 
independent of the housing types that had been approved. The City worked with Mr. 
Dhami and reviewed what the home type would need to be and how they fit within the 
required setbacks. 

Mr. Dhami presented several models that could be used on any of the sites thus 
"masterplanning" the final construction to reduce potential additional costs. These 
were reviewed and accepted as viable substitutions for the proposed lot development. 

Land Use 
The project site is zoned R-1, Single Family Residential District with a General Plan land use 
designation of Residential, Low Density. The single-family residential district now has four (4) 
designations: 

1.  R-1A Parcels sized from 1,700 — 3,500 square feet 
2.  R-1B Parcels sized from 3,501— 5,999 square feet 
3.  R1-C Parcels sized from 6,000 — 7,499 square feet 
4.  R-1 

Parcels sized from 7,500 and greater 

The parcel is considered R-1. 

Setback Requirements 
The setback requirements for a corner lot are 20% of the frontage distance with a minimum of 
5' on the interior boundary and 20' on the street side. The site is approximately 67.8 feet wide. 
Generally, the setback required would be approximately 13.6 feet for an interior lot. The 
requirement to have 20 feet and five feet realizes 42.8 feet available for the width of a new 
home. 

Front Yard: 
Interior Side Yard: 
Rear Yard: 
Street Side: 

20' 
5' 
5' 
20' 

The proposed structure is 44' in width. This allows only an 18' street side setback. Although 
the applicant is requesting a reduction to 18', it is appropriate to reduce it to 15' to allow some 
room for placement during construction.

the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, 
comfort and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such 
proposed use. 
This use would not be detrimental to the general welfare of the residents, is a temporary 
use and would not be detrimental to the surrounding neighbors. Therefore, this finding can 
be made. 

3.  That the use will not be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the 
neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city or substantially impede enactment of 
the comprehensive plan. 
The recreational vehicle will be screened from view by the existing residence. The proposal
