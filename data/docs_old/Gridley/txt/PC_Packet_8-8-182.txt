Conditional Use Permit No. 3-18;  Application for a conditional use 
permit to allow residential use in the General Commercial (C-2) zoning 
district located at 1296 Highway 99. (APN: 024-270-001) 

Recommendation 

City staff respectfully recommends the Planning Commission:

2. 
3. 

Find the project is categorically exempt from environmental review pursuant to the 
California Environmental Quality Act, Section 15301, Existing Facilities, Class 1; and, 
Make the required conditional use findings as described within the staff report; and, 
Approve Conditional Use Permit 3-18 subject to the conditions attached to the staff 
report as Exhibit A. 

SUMMARY 
The applicant is requesting a conditional use permit in order to continue the use of the 
property as an existing single family residence in the General Commercial (C-2) zoning district. 
The property was developed with single family residential uses in the late 1940's. This property 
was rezoned along the Highway 99 commercial corridor although it was still being used as 
single family residential. Without the Conditional Use Permit, the owner would not be able to 
replace the unit if damage were to occur, or to make improvements. 

SITE DESCRIPTION 
The subject site is located on the east side of Highway 99 between Obernneyer Avenue and 
Sheldon Avenue. The site is approximately one acre in size surrounded by commercial uses 
(Pacific Motel) to the north, agriculture to the east, single family residential and agriculture 
uses to the south. The site is bounded by Highway 99 with industrial uses and agriculture to the 
west of the highway.

DISCUSSION 
Conditional use permits (CUP) are entitlements that once activated are tied to the property 
without expiring unless so conditioned. In order to maintain the ability to continue to reside 
and/or legally alter or rebuild the structures on the site, a conditional use permit is required to 
establish the use in the C-2 zoning district. Should the Planning Commission vote favorably, this 
entitlement will allow the continued residential use. 

The Gridley Municipal Code allows residential use in the General Commercial District with a 
conditional use permit. No limitations are described within the code that would not allow the 
continued use.

FINDINGS 
The Planning Commission is required to make the following Findings of Fact for quasi-judicial 
actions of which this is. 

Conditional Use Permit Findings: 

1. The proposed use is in accordance with the objectives of the Commercial General Plan land 

use designation and General Commercial (C-2) zoning district. 
Approval of a conditional use permit will create an allowable use for this parcel in the land 
use district noted; therefore this finding can be made. 

2.  That the establishment, maintenance, or operations of the use applied for will not, under 

the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, 
comfort and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such 
proposed use. 
The continued use of the property with a single family residential unit will not be detrimental 
to the health, safety, peace, comfort and general welfare of persons residing or working in 
the neighborhood of such proposed use; therefore this finding can be made. 

3.  That the use will not be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the 
neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city or substantially impede enactment of 
the comprehensive plan. 
The use of the property as a single family use will not be detrimental or injurious to property 
and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city or substantially 
impede enactment of the comprehensive plan; therefore this finding can be made. 

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW 
The proposed project is categorically exempt from environmental review pursuant to the 
California Environmental Quality Act, Section 15301, Existing Facilities, Class 1. 

CONCLUSION 
Approving a conditional use for continued single family residential use will allow the site to 
maintain its historical use and will allow the reconstruction and general maintenance and 
improvement of the structure should they be destroyed by fire or other calamity.

California Statutes 

The following description of California Law related to group housing in California is excerpted 
from "Select California laws Relating to Residential Recovery Facilities and Group Homes" 
authored by Barbara Kautz of the Law Offices of Goldfarb & Lipman LLP. This document was 
prepared for the Third Annual Fair Housing & Public Accommodations Symposium, Golden Gate 
University, April 22, 2011. 

A complex set of statutes requires that cities and counties treat small, licensed group 
homes like single-family homes. Inpatient and outpatient psychiatric facilities, including 
residential facilities for the mentally ill, must also be allowed in certain zoning districts. 

The State Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs ("ADP") licenses facilities serving six 
or fewer persons that provide residential non-medical services to adults who are 
recovering from problems related to alcohol or drugs and need treatment or 
detoxification services. Individuals in recovery from drug and alcohol addiction are defined 
as disabled under the Fair Housing Act. This category of disability includes both individuals 
recovering in licensed detoxification facilities and recovering alcoholics or drug users who 
may live in "clean and sober" living facilities. 

Licensed group homes serving six or fewer residents must be treated like single-family 
homes or single dwelling units for zoning purposes.12  In other words, a licensed group 
home serving six or fewer residents must be a permitted use in all residential zones in 
which a single-family home is permitted, with the same parking requirements, setbacks, 
design standards, and the like. No conditional use permit, variance, or special permit can 
be required for these small group homes unless the same permit is required for single-
family homes, nor can parking standards be higher, nor can special design standards be 

Page 3 of 6 

August 8, 2018 Planning Commission Meeting 

Public Hearing: Item 6C - Conditional Use Permit 5-18 

imposed. The statutes specifically state that these facilities cannot be considered to be 
boarding houses or rest homes or regulated as such. Staff members and operators of the 
facility may reside in the home in addition to those served. 

The property is zoned General Commercial (C-2) zoning and requires a conditional use 
permit to allow residential in a commercial zone. The proposed use having six or fewer 
persons living at the location as a described 'family" meets the description of residential use. 

Occupancy limits 

The Uniform Housing Code (the "UHC") establishes occupancy limits—the number of 
people who may live in a house of a certain size—and in almost all circumstances 
municipalities may not adopt more restrictive limits. The UHC provides that at least one 
room in a dwelling unit must have 120 square feet. Other rooms must have at least 70 
square feet (except kitchens). If more than two persons are using a room for sleeping 
purposes, there must be an additional 50 square feet for each additional person. Using this 
standard, the occupancy limit would be seven persons for a 400-sq. ft. studio apartment 
(the size of a standard two-car garage). Locallyadopted occupancy limits cannot be more 
restrictive than the UHC unless justified based on local climatic, geological, or 
topographical conditions. Efforts by cities to adopt more restrictive standards based on 
other impacts (such as parking and noise) have been overturned in California. 

The residence is approximately 812 square feet which would accommodate the proposed six 
persons at this location. 

PUBLIC NOTICE 
Notices were mailed to the surrounding property owners within a 300-foot radius of the subject 
site. A notice was also published in the Gridley Herald, posted at City Hall, and on the city 
website. At the time this report was prepared, no comments had been received. 

FINDINGS 
The Planning Commission is required to make the following Findings of Fact for quasi-judicial 
actions of which this is. 

Conditional Use Permit Findings: 

1. The proposed use is in accordance with the objectives of the Commercial General Plan land 

use designation and General Commercial (C-2) zoning district. 
Approval of a conditional use permit will create an allowable use for this parcel in the land 
use district noted; therefore, this finding can be made. 

Page 4 of 6 

August 8, 2018 Planning Commission Meeting 

Public Hearing: Item 6C - Conditional Use Permit 5-18 

2.  That the establishment, maintenance, or operations of the use applied for will not, under 

the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, 
comfort and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such 
proposed use. 
The continued use of the property with a single family residential unit will not be detrimental 
to the health, safety, peace, comfort and general welfare of persons residing or working in 
the neighborhood of such proposed use; therefore, this finding can be made. 

3.  That the use will not be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the 
neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city or substantially impede enactment of 
the comprehensive plan. 
The use of the property as a single family use will not be detrimental or injurious to property 
and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city or substantially 
impede enactment of the comprehensive plan; therefore this finding can be made. 

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW 
The proposed project is categorically exempt from environmental review pursuant to the 
California Environmental Quality Act, Section 15301, Existing Facilities, Class 1. 

CONCLUSION 
Approving a conditional use for single family residential use will allow the site to provide a much 
needed service, maintain an historic residential use. 

The property owner is requesting a conditional use permit to allow residential use to continue in 
the commercial zone (CUP 4-18). Should that request be approved, the Planning Commission 
would be able to consider the residential recovery facility to be a single family use. The proposal 
meets with the requirements of the Gridley Municipal Code. There are case studies where this 
use may be considered a commercial use, whereas the concern would be in allowing a 
Planning has brought the project to the Planning 
commercial use in a residential zone. (cid:9)

Introduction 

This paper summarizes California statutes and case law regarding planning and zoning 
requirements applicable to group homes and supportive housing that impose limitations on local 
governments beyond those imposed by the federal Fair Housing Act and state Fair Employment 
and Housing Act. The paper first reviews state statutes that protect certain licensed group homes 
and describes provisions of State Planning and Zoning Law that are applicable more generally to 
both licensed and unlicensed homes. It then explains California case law relating to the right of 
privacy, which prevents local governments from discriminating between households containing 
related persons and those comprised of unrelated individuals. It concludes by discussing local 
regulations that appear to be permissible under State law and fair housing law. 

II. 

Statutes Protecting Licensed Facilities 

A complex set of statutes requires that cities and counties treat small, licensed group homes like 
single-family homes. Inpatient and outpatient psychiatric facilities, including residential facilities 
for the mentally ill, must also be allowed in certain zoning districts. 

A. (cid:9)

California Licensing Laws 

California has adopted a complicated licensing scheme in which group homes providing certain 
kinds of care and supervision must be licensed. Some licensed homes cannot be closer than 300 
feet to each other, while other licensed homes have no separation requirements. All licensed 
facilities serving six or fewer persons must be treated like single-family homes for zoning 
purposes. 

While this section discusses some of the most common licensed facilities, it does not include 
every type of license or facility regulated in this complex area of law. 

1. (cid:9)

Community Care Facilities 

Community care facilities must be licensed by the California Department of Social Services 
(CDSS),I  A "community care facility" is a facility where non-medical care and supervision are 
provided for children or adults in need of personal services.2  Facilities serving adults typically 
provide care and supervision for persons between 18-59 years of age who need a supportive 
living environment. Residents are usually mentally or developmentally disabled. The services 
provided may include assistance in dressing and bathing; supervision of client activities; 
monitoring of food intake; or oversight of the client's property.3  

CDSS separately licenses residential care facilities for the elderly and residential care facilities 
for the chronically ill. Residential care facilities for the elderly provide varying levels of non-

medical care and supervision for persons 60 years of age or older.4  Residential care facilities for 
the chronically ill provide treatment for persons with AIDS or HIV disease.5  

Drug and Alcohol Treatment Facilities 

The State Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs ("ADP") licenses facilities serving six or 
fewer persons that provide residential non-medical services to adults who are recovering from 
problems related to alcohol or drugs and need treatment or detoxification services.6  Individuals 
in recovery from drug and alcohol addiction are defined as disabled under the Fair Housing Act.7  
This category of disability includes both individuals recovering in licensed detoxification 
facilities and recovering alcoholics or drug users who may live in "clean and sober" living 
facilities. 

3. (cid:9)

Health Facilities 

The State Department of Health Services and State Department of Mental Health license a 
variety of residential health care facilities serving six or fewer persons.8  These include 
"congregate living health facilities" which provide in-patient care to no more than six persons 
who may be terminally ill, ventilator dependent, or catastrophically and severely disabled9  and 
intermediate care facilities for persons who need intermittent nursing care.10  Pediatric day health 
and respite care facilities with six or fewer beds are separately licensed.] I  

B. (cid:9)

Protection from Land Use Regulations for Certain Licensed Facilities 

Small facilities licensed under these sections of California law and serving six or fewer residents 
must be treated by local governments identically to single-family homes. Additional protection 
from discrimination is provided to certain psychiatric facilities. However, some group homes 
may be subject to spacing requirements. 

1. (cid:9)

Limitations on Zoning Control of Small Group Homes Serving Six or 
Fewer Residents  

Licensed group homes serving six or fewer residents must be treated like single-family homes or 
single dwelling units for zoning purposes.I2  In other words, a licensed group home serving six or 
fewer residents must be a permitted use in all residential zones in which a single-family home is

1267.9, & 1267.16), residential care facilities for the elderly (Health & Safety Code 1568.083 - 1568.0831, 1569.82 
— 1569.87), community care facilities (Health & Safety Code 1518, 1520.5, 1566 - 1566.8, 1567.1, pediatric day 
health facilities (Health & Safety Code 1267.9; 1760— 1761.8), and facilities for alcohol and drug treatment (Health 
& Safety Code 11834.23).

permitted, with the same parking requirements, setbacks, design standards, and the like. No 
conditional use permit, variance, or special permit can be required for these small group homes 
unless the same permit is required for single-family homes, nor can parking standards be higher, 
nor can special design standards be imposed. The statutes specifically state that these facilities 
cannot be considered to be boarding houses or rest homes or regulated as such.I3  Staff members 
and operators of the facility may reside in the home in addition to those served. 

Homeowners' associations and other residents also cannot enforce restrictive covenants limiting 
uses of homes to "private residences" to exclude group homes for the disabled serving six or 
fewer persons.I4  

The Legislature in 2006 adopted AB 2184 (Bogh) to clarify that communities may fully enforce 
local ordinances against these facilities, including fines and other penalties, so long as the 
ordinances do not distinguish residential facilities from other single-family homes.I5  

Because there are no separation requirements for drug and alcohol treatment facilities, ADP has 
in practice been willing to issue separate licenses for 'small' drug and alcohol treatment facilities 
whenever a dwelling unit or structure has a separate address. For instance, ADP has issued a 
separate license for each apartment in one multifamily building, for each single-family home in a 
six-home compound, and for each cottage in a hotel, in each case creating facilities that in fact 
serve many more than six residents. No local effort to regulate these facilities as 'large' 
residential care facilities has been successful in a published case; in other contexts, the courts 
have determined that the State has completely preempted local regulation of small residential 
care facilities.I6  

2. (cid:9)

Facilities Serving More Than Six Residents 

Because California law only protects licensed facilities serving six or fewer residents, many 
cities and counties restrict the location of facilities housing seven or more clients. They may do 
this by requiring use permits, adopting special parking and other standards for these homes, or 
prohibiting these large facilities outright in certain zoning districts. While this practice may raise 
fair housing issues, no published California decision prohibits the practice. Some cases in other 
federal circuits have found that requiring a conditional use permit for large group homes violates 
the federal Fair Housing Act.I7  However, the federal Ninth Circuit, whose decisions are binding 
in California, found that requiring a conditional use permit for a building atypical in size and 
bulk for a single-family residence does not violate the Fair Housing Act.I8

A city or county cannot require an annual review of a group home's operations as a condition of 
a use permit. The Ninth Circuit has held that an annual review provision adopted as a condition 
of a special use permit was not consistent with the Fair Housing Act.I9  

In 2006, the Legislature passed a bill (SB 1322) sponsored by State Senator Cedillo that would 
have required all communities to designate sites where licensed facilities with seven or more 
residents could locate either as a permitted use or with a use permit. It was motivated by 
newspaper reports of suburban communities' "dumping" the mentally ill and homeless in big 
cities. Although SB 1322 was vetoed by the Governor, changes were later made in Housing 
Element law to protect certain transitional and supportive housing, as discussed further below. 

3. 

Siting of Inpatient and Outpatient Psychiatric Facilities 

Cities must allow health facilities for both inpatient and outpatient psychiatric care and treatment 
in any area zoned for hospitals or nursing homes, or in which hospitals and nursing homes are 
permitted with a conditional use permit.2°  "Health facilities" include residential care facilities for 
mentally ill persons. This means that if a zoning ordinance permits hospitals or nursing homes in 
an area, it must also permit all types of mental health facilities, regardless of the number of 
patients or residents. This is important because most cities are supportive of hospitals and 
nursing zones and may allow them in areas where they would normally not wish to allow large 
facilities for the mentally ill. 

In one case, a residential care facility for 16 mentally ill persons was refused a permit in an R-2 
zoning district where "rest homes" and "convalescent homes" were permitted, but not "nursing 
homes." Since the zoning district did not permit "nursing homes" or hospitals, the City believed 
that it was able to forbid the use in that zoning district. However, the court found that the City's 
definitions of "rest homes" and "convalescent homes" were very similar to its definition of 
"nursing homes"—rest homes and convalescent homes were, in effect, nursing homes—and so 
held that the City must allow the residential facility for mentally ill persons within that zoning 
district.21  

4. 

Separation Requirements for Certain Licensed Facilities 

CDSS must deny an application for certain group homes if the new facility would result in 
"overconcentration." For community care facilities,22  intermediate care facilities, and pediatric 
day health and respite care facilities,23  "overconcentration" is defined as a separation of less than 
300 feet from another licensed "residential care facility," measured from the outside walls of the 
structure housing the facility. Congregate living health facilities must be separated by 1,000 
feet.24

(cid:9)
These separation requirements do not apply to residential care facilities for the elderly, drug and 
alcohol treatment facilities, foster family homes, or "transitional shelter care facilities," which 
provide immediate shelter for children removed from their homes. None of the separation 
requirements have been challenged under the federal Fair Housing Act, although separation 
requirements have been challenged in other states.25  

CDSS must submit any application for a facility covered by the law to the city where the facility 
will be located. The city may request that the license be denied based on overconcentration or 
may ask that the license be approved. CDSS cannot approve a facility located within 300 feet of 
an existing facility (or within 1,000 feet of a congregate living health facility) unless the city 
approves the application. Even if there is adequate separation between the facilities, a city or 
county may ask that the license be denied based on overconcentration.26  

These separation requirements apply only to facilities with the same type of license. For instance, 
a community care facility would not violate the separation requirements even if located next to a 
drug and alcohol treatment facility. 

C. (cid:9)

Facilities That Do Not Need a License 

Housing in which some services are provided to persons with disabilities may not require 
licensing. In housing financed under certain federal housing programs, including Sections 202, 
221(d)(3), 236, and 811, if residents obtain care and supervision independently from a third party 
that is not the housing provider, then the housing provider need not obtain a license.27  
"Supportive housing" and independent living facilities with "community living support services," 
both of which provide some services to disabled people, generally do not need to be licensed.28  
Recovery homes providing group living arrangements for people who have graduated from drug 
and alcohol programs, but which do not provide care or supervision, also do not need to be 
licensed.29  

The result is that many situations exist where persons with disabilities will live together and 
receive some services in unlicensed facilities. Because State law does not require that these 
facilities be treated as single-family homes, some communities have attempted to classify them 
as lodging houses or other commercial uses and require special permits. Distinguishing a 
"lodging house" from a "residence" is discussed in more detail in the next section. However, 
courts in other jurisdictions have found that when the state does not provide a license for a type 
of facility, cities cannot discriminate against facilities merely because they are unlicensed.30  
Although there is no case on point in California or the Ninth Circuit, ordinances requiring greater 
regulation for unlicensed homes with fewer services than licensed homes providing more 
services could raise fair housing issues, although an argument can also be made that unlicensed 
facilities are completely unregulated and hence require more local supervision. Some 

25  Based on cases from other states, the 1,000-foot limit for congregate living health facilities is unlikely to be 
upheld. Spacing requirements that have been challenged have required 500-foot separations or more.

communities have explicitly adopted ordinances stating that unlicensed group homes serving six 
or fewer clients are permitted in residential zones.31  

Legislation was introduced in California in 2006 to make clear that communities could regulate 
unlicensed facilities with six or fewer residents. This provision was ultimately removed after 
receiving fierce opposition from advocates for the disabled and State agencies responsible for 
finding placements for foster children and recovering drug and alcohol abusers. 

III. California Planning and Zoning Laws 

California Planning and Zoning Law has long contained provisions prohibiting discrimination in 
land use decisions based on disability. Effective January 1, 2002, state housing element law was 
amended to require an analysis of constraints on persons with disabilities and to require 
programs providing reasonable accommodation. Additional protections for supportive and 
transitional housing became effective on January 1, 2008. 

A. 

Protection from Discrimination in Land Use Decisions 

California's Planning and Zoning Law prohibits discrimination in local governments' zoning and 
land use actions based on (among other categories) race, sex, lawful occupation, familial status, 
disability, source of income, method of financing, or occupancy by low to middle income 
persons.-'2  It also prevents agencies from imposing different requirements on single-family or 
multifamily homes because of the familial status, disability, or income of the intended 
residents.33  

In general, the statute serves the same purposes and requires the same proof as a violation of the 
federal Fair Housing Act.34  However, federal fair housing law does not specifically limit 
discrimination based on income level,35  and Section 65008 makes clear that discrimination based 
on disability is prohibited in local planning and zoning decisions. 

B. 

Housing Elements 

California requires that each city and county adopt a 'housing element' as part of its general plan 
for the growth of the community.36  The housing element governs the development of housing in 
the community. It must identify sites for all types of housing, including transitional housing, 
supportive housing, and emergency shelters. Beginning in 2002, local housing elements were 
required to analyze constraints on housing for persons with disabilities and to include programs 

31  For instance, one community adopted zoning provisions stating that "residential service facilities" serving 6 or 
fewer clients could be permitted in any residential zone, defining such uses as: "A residential facility, other than a 
residential care facility or single housekeeping unit, designed for the provision of personal services in addition to 
housing, or where the operator receives compensation for the provision of personal services in addition to housing. 
Personal services may include, but are not limited to, protection, care, supervision, counseling, guidance, training, 
education, therapy, or other nonmedical care."

(cid:9)
to remove constraints or to provide reasonable accommodations for housing designed for persons 
with disabilities.37  The California Attorney General also sent a letter to local planning agencies 
in May 2001 urging them to adopt reasonable accommodation ordinances. As a consequence, 
many cities and counties in the State now have a separate reasonable accommodation ordinance 
that may be applicable to group homes serving disabled persons, whether licensed or unlicensed. 

Amendments to housing element law effective January 1, 200838  specifically require cities and 
counties to include in their housing elements a program to remove constraints so that 'supportive 
housing,' as defined in the bill, is treated like other residences of the same type. This means that 
communities must revise their zoning so that the only restrictions that may be applied to 
supportive housing, as defined in the statute, are those that apply to other residences of the same 
type (single-family homes, duplexes, triplexes, or fourplexes) in the same zoning district; no 
conditional use permit or other permit is required unless other residences of that type in the same 
zone also must obtain the same permit. 

However, to qualify for this protection, the supportive housing must meet the definition of 
"supportive housing" contained in Health & Safety Code Section 50675.14, which is housing 
that: 

•  Has no limit on the length of stay. 

• 

• 

Is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist residents in improving their health status, 
retaining the housing, and living and working in the community. 

Is occupied by the "target population," defined as adults with low incomes having one or 
more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other 
chronic health problems; and persons eligible for services under the Lanterman 
Development Disabilities Act, which provides services to persons with developmental 
disabilities that originated before the person turned 18. 

Should a group home meeting this definition of "supportive housing" require a permit of any 
type, California's "Housing Accountability Act" will allow it to be denied only under very 
limited circumstances.39  

37  Cal. Gov't Code 65583(a)(4); 65583(c)(3). 
38  Cal. Gov't Code 65583(a)(5). 
39  Cal. Gov't Code 65589.5(d). Local governments cannot deny supportive housing, or add conditions that make the 
housing infeasible, unless they can make one of five findings: 

•  The jurisdiction has met its low income housing needs. 
•  The housing would have a specific, adverse impact on public health or safety, and there is no feasible way 

to mitigate the impact. 

•  Denial is required to comply with state or federal law, and there is no way to comply without making the 

housing unaffordable. 

•  The housing is proposed on land zoned for agriculture and is surrounded on two sides by land being used 

for agriculture, or there is inadequate water or sewer service. 

•  The housing is inconsistent with both the zoning and the land use designation of the site and is not shown 

in the housing element as an affordable housing site.

(cid:9)
Many privately operated group homes have limitations on the length of stay and are not occupied 
by adults with low incomes and so do not qualify as "supportive housing" under this definition; 
but many group homes funded under California's Mental Health Services Act do so qualify. 

IV. Protections Provided by the California Right to Privacy 

Unlike the federal Constitution, California's Constitution contains an express right to privacy, 
adopted by the voters in 1972. The California Supreme Court has found that this right includes 
"the right to be left alone in our own homes" and has explained that "the right to choose with 
whom to live is fundamental."40  Consequently, the California courts have struck down local 
ordinances that attempt to control who lives in a household—whether families or unrelated 
persons, whether healthy or disabled, whether renters or owners. On the other hand, the courts 
will support ordinances that regulate the use of a residence for commercial purposes. 

Consequently, communities that desire to regulate group homes have attempted to define them as 
commercial uses similar to boarding houses rather than restricting who lives there. 

A. (cid:9)

Families v. Unrelated Persons in a Household 

In many states, local communities can control the number of unrelated people permitted to live in 
a household. However, based on the privacy clause in the State Constitution, California case law 
requires cities to treat groups of related and unrelated people identically when they function as 
one household.41  Local ordinances that define a "family" in terms of blood, marriage, or 
adoption, and that treat unrelated groups differently from "families," violate California law. 
California cities cannot limit the number of unrelated people who live together while allowing an 
unlimited number of family members to live in a dwelling. 

In the lead case of City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson, Mrs. Adamson owned a very large 6,200 
sq. ft., 10-bedroom single-family home that she rented to twelve "congenial people." They 
became "a close group with social, economic, and psychological commitments to each other. 
They shared expenses, rotated chores, ate evening meals together" and considered themselves a 
family. 

However, Santa Barbara defined a family as either "two (2) or more persons related by blood, 
marriage or legal adoption living together as a single housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit," or a 
maximum of five unrelated adults. The court considered the twelve residents to be an "alternate 
family" that achieved many of the personal and practical needs served by traditional families. 
The twelve met half the definition of "family," because they lived as a single housekeeping unit. 
However, they were not related by blood. The court found that the right of privacy guaranteed 
them the right to choose whom to live with. The purposes put forth by Santa Barbara to justify 
the ordinance—such as a concern about parking—could be handled by neutral ordinances 
applicable to all households, not just unrelated individuals, such as applying limits on the number 
of cars to all households. "In general, zoning ordinances are much less suspect when they focus 
on the use than when they command inquiry into who are the users."42

(cid:9)
Despite this long-standing rule, a 2002 study found that one-third of local zoning ordinances, 
including that of the City of Los Angeles, still contained illegal definitions of "family" that 
included limits on the number of unrelated people in a household:43  While most cities were 
aware that these limits were illegal and did not enforce them, interviews with staff members in 
the City of Los Angeles, for example, found that many did attempt to enforce the limits on the 
number of unrelated persons.44  

If a group of people living together can meet the definition of a "household" or "family," there is 
no limit on the number of people who are permitted to live together, except for Housing Code 
limits discussed in the next section. By comparison, many ordinances regulate licensed group 
homes more strictly if they have seven or more residents, by defining such licensed facilities as a 
separate use. 

Since Adamson, the California courts have struggled to determine when zoning ordinances are 
focusing on the occupants of the home and when they are focusing on the use of the home. In 
particular, courts have struck down ordinances that: 

•  Limited the residents of a second dwelling unit to the property owner, his/her dependent, 

or a caregiver for the owner or dependent:45  

•  Allowed owner-occupied properties to have more residents than renter-occupied 

properties.46  

• 

Imposed regulations on tenancies-in-common that had the effect of requiring unrelated 
persons to share occupancy of their units with each other.47  

On the other hand, the courts have upheld regulations when they were convinced that the city's 
primary purpose was to prevent non-residential or commercial use in a residential area. In 
particular, the courts have upheld ordinances that: 

•  Regulated businesses in single-family residences ("home occupations") and limited 

employees to residents of the home.48  

•  Prohibited short-term transient rentals of properties for less than thirty days.49

Occupancy Limits  

The Uniform Housing Code (the "UHC") establishes occupancy limits—the number of people 
who may live in a house of a certain size—and in almost all circumstances municipalities may

not adopt more restrictive limits. The UHC provides that at least one room in a dwelling unit 
must have 120 square feet. Other rooms must have at least 70 square feet (except kitchens). If 
more than two persons are using a room for sleeping purposes, there must be an additional 50 
square feet for each additional person.5°  Using this standard, the occupancy limit would be seven 
persons for a 400-sq. ft. studio apartment (the size of a standard two-car garage). Locally adopted 
occupancy limits cannot be more restrictive than the UHC unless justified based on local 
climatic, geological, or topographical conditions. Efforts by cities to adopt more restrictive 
standards based on other impacts (such as parking and noise) have been overturned in 
California.51  

Similarly, the Ninth Circuit found that a local ordinance that limited the number of persons in a 
homeless shelter to 15, when the building code would allow 25 persons, was unreasonable, and 
found that allowing 25 persons in the shelter would constitute a reasonable accommodation.52  

Based on these federal and state precedents, localities may not limit the number of people living 
in a dwelling below that permitted by the UHC. 

V. Local Regulation of Group Homes 

In the past decade, much local concern has been directed at sober living homes, which are 
typically unlicensed facilities designed to provide support to recovering substance abusers. 
Because privately operated sober living homes often desire to attract middle- and upper middle-
income residents, and there is a high demand for such facilities, they have often been located in 
middle- and upper-class areas, and in some cases have experienced local opposition. The League 
of California Cities has sponsored legislation designed to require licensing or allow more local 
control, but those efforts have failed. Communities often view such facilities as businesses 
exploiting a loophole rather than as residences and so seek to be able to distinguish them from 
residences, often defining them as "lodging houses" or "boarding houses." Lodging houses 
typically require a conditional use permit and are not permitted in single-family residential 
zones. Conversely, sober living homes seek to be classified as "households" or "single 
housekeeping units" so they may locate in any residential neighborhood without requiring any 
public notice or needing any use permit. 

A. (cid:9)

Defining Unlicensed Facilities as Lodging Houses or Single Housekeeping 
Units 

A 2003 opinion of the State Attorney General found that communities may prohibit or regulate 
the operation of a lodging house in a single family zone in order to preserve the residential 
character of the neighborhood.53  The City of Lompoc defined a lodging house as "a residence or 
dwelling . . . wherein three or more rooms, with or without individual or group cooking facilities, 
are rented to individuals under separate rental agreements or leases, either written or oral, 
whether or not an owner, agent or rental manager is in residence." The Attorney General agreed 

5°  Cal. Health and Safety Code 17922(a)(1). See Briseno v. City of Santa Ana, 6 Cal. App. 4th 1378, 1381-82 (1992) 
(holding that the state Uniform Housing Code preempts local regulation of occupancy limits).

(cid:9)
that a lodging house, while providing a 'residence' to paying customers, could be considered a 
commercial use and so could be prohibited in residential areas. ("There is no question but that 
municipalities are entitled to confine commercial activities to certain districts [citations], and that 
they may further limit activities within those districts by requiring use permits."54) 

The Attorney General further concluded that the ordinance was consistent with Adamson because 
it would allow any owner of property to rent to any member of the public and any member of the 
public to apply for lodging. The proposed ordinance would be directed at a commercial use of 
property inconsistent with the residential character of the neighborhood regardless of the identity 
of the users. 

Based on the Attorney General's opinion and Adamson, then, cities have increasingly defined a 
"household" or "single housekeeping unit" to have these characteristics: 

•  One joint lease signed by all residents; 

•  Access by all to all common areas of the home; and 

•  Shared housekeeping and shared household expenses. 

•  No limits on length of residence. 

•  New residents selected by existing residents, not a manager or landlord. 

For instance, the City of Los Angeles proposed an ordinance defining a "single housekeeping 
unit" as: 

One household where all the members have common access to and common use of all 
living, kitchen, and eating areas within the dwelling unit, and household activities and 
responsibilities such as meals, chores, expenses, and maintenance of the premises are 
shared or carried out according to a household plan or other customary method. If all or 
part of the dwelling unit is rented, the lessees must jointly occupy the unit under a single 
lease, either written or oral, whether for monetary or non-monetary consideration. 

The same ordinance proposed to define a boarding or rooming house as: 

A one-family dwelling, or a dwelling with five or fewer guest rooms or suites of rooms, 
where lodging is provided to individuals with or without meals, for monetary or non-
monetary consideration under two or more separate agreements or leases, either written 
or oral. 

Under these and similar ordinance definitions, many sober living homes operated by private 
organizations, whether for-profit or nonprofit, are classified as boarding or lodging houses 
because residents do not sign a joint lease; new residents are selected by a manager; household 
expenses may not be shared (i.e., residents pay a set fee to the manager); and there may be limits 

990051 \ 1 \ 963008.1 
3/23/2011 

11 

(cid:9)
on length of residence. In contrast, persons who desire to live together to support each other 
during recovery and rent a home together would be classified as a "single housekeeping unit." 

Enforcement Issues. If a group home is challenged as not constituting a single housekeeping unit, 
the operator will likely assert that it is indeed operating as a single unit. Unless there is public 
information available showing that a residence is operated as a lodging house (e.g., web 
advertising), an investigation would be required to demonstrate otherwise. If complaints were 
based primarily on the disability of the occupants (which could include their status as recovering 
drug and alcohol abusers), then California privacy rights and fair housing laws might be 
implicated. In one Washington, D.C., case, a federal district court found a violation of the federal 
Fair Housing Act where the Zoning Administrator carried out a detailed investigation of a 
residence for five mentally ill men in response to neighbors' concerns, finding that the Zoning 
Administrator's actions were motivated in part by the neighbors' fears about the residents' mental 
illness.55  In California, a similar challenge might be additionally based on rights of privacy and 
equal protection concerns. 

B. (cid:9)

Best Practices - Service Providers 

We advise our nonprofit sponsors that if a facility can be considered a single housekeeping unit, 
the facility must be treated as a residence with one family residing in it. The most defensible 
structure for such a facility would be to: 

•  Have one rental agreement or lease signed by all occupants. If, instead, the provider 
signs the lease and each resident has a verbal or written agreement with the provider, 
then the facility could be considered a "lodging house" under the definition upheld by 
the Attorney General. 

•  Give all residents equal access to all living and eating areas and food preparation and 

service areas. 

•  Keep track of, and share, household expenses. 

•  Do not require occupants to move after a certain period of time, except for time limits 

imposed by the rental agreement or lease with the owner. 

•  Allow all existing residents to select new members of the household. 

VI. Conclusion 

In my own experience as a former city official, many group homes were invisible in the 
community and caused few problems. Most complaints about overcrowding and excessive 
vehicles did not involve a group home, but rather the poorest areas where space was rented out to 
the limits of the Housing Code. 

The group homes that caused the most concern were sober living facilities which tended to 
concentrate in certain inexpensive single-family neighborhoods. In one case, all five homes on

one block face were purchased by a single owner. He was knowledgeable about his rights but 
unconcerned about his obligations, and sneered at the City's and neighborhood's concerns. Since 
the facilities were unlicensed, there was no regulatory oversight. When the occupant of one home 
was arrested for drug dealing, it caused an uproar. 

Many providers are conscious of their position in neighborhoods and make an effort to 
accommodate community concerns. Others may be perceived as arrogant and dismissive of local 
concerns, viewing all neighbors as "NIMBYs." Providers who view themselves as part of the 
community and set house rules that encourage community involvement, restrict noise, control 
parking, and establish smoking locations not visible from the street can go a long way toward 
abating perceived problems. 

Cities should modify their zoning ordinances to address unlicensed group homes and decide on a 
strategy for dealing with group homes with seven or more persons (use permit and reasonable 
accommodation). State legislation requiring some minimal licensing for sober living facilities 
would also be beneficial to set standards for minimal levels of care. Cities need also to avoid the 
kind of incidents that result in the Legislature's willingness to further constrain local control of 
these homes.

SUMMARY: GROUP HOME ANALYSIS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW 

IF LICENSED:  

6 or fewer clients: 

Must be treated' like a single-family home for all zoning purposes, except for 
spacing requirements for certain licensed facilities (e.g., community care 
facilities). Community care facilities for the elderly and drug and alcohol 
treatment centers do not have spacing requirements. 

7 or more clients: 

Psychiatric facilities—both inpatient and outpatient—must be permitted in 
any zone that permits nursing homes or hospitals as conditional or permitted uses. 
(City of Torrance v. Transitional Living Centers) 

Other licensed facilities are often subject to a use permit and may not be 
permitted in certain zones. Advocates may request a reasonable accommodation 
to avoid use permit requirements or to obtain modifications to traditional zoning 
requirements. But the Ninth Circuit has not found a use permitper se to violate 
the Fair Housing Act. (Gamble v. City of Escondido) 

IF UNLICENSED: 

Is it operated as a single housekeeping unit (household, family)? 

If so, must be treated like a single dwelling unit. 
Unlicensed homes are more likely to be considered as a single housekeeping unit 
if they meet the following tests: 

•  Physical access: all have access to common areas: kitchen, laundry, living 

& family rooms is free. 

•  No limits on term of occupancy 
•  All residents on lease or rental agreement [AG's opinion] 
•  Makeup of the household is determined by the residents rather than a 

landlord or property manager 

•  Normal household activities (meals, chores) and household expenses 

shared (Adamson) 

There are different local definitions of "family" or a single housekeeping unit. 
(For instance, some localities do not use the existence of separate rental 
agreements as a test for a single housekeeping unit.) Advocates oppose some of 
the above characteristics. 

990051\1\963008.1

(cid:9)
Does it qualify as "supportive housing" under housing element law? 

If so, must be treated like other residences of the same physical type [depending 
on date of adoption of housing element]. 

6 or fewer clients: 

Fair housing argument if treated more strictly than licensed facilities; but no case 
in California holds this specifically. 

Defined as a boarding house or another use? 

Only the use can be regulated, not the user. 
Group homes for the disabled cannot be treated in a discriminatory fashion from 
other group homes (boarding houses, dormitories, etc.).

Planning Commission 

FROM: (cid:9)

Donna Decker, Planning Department 

SUBJECT: (cid:9)

Conditional Use Permit No. 6-18;  Application for a conditional use 
permit to allow a height increase from twelve feet to sixteen feet for a 
monument sign in the General Commercial (C-2) zoning district located at 
1646 Highway 99. (APN: 010-210-057) 

Recommendation 

City staff respectfully recommends the Planning Commission: 

1. 

2. 
3. 

Find the project is categorically exempt from environmental review pursuant to the 
California Environmental Quality Act, Section 15311, Accessory Structures, Class 11; and, 
Make the required conditional use findings as described within the staff report; and, 
Approve Conditional Use Permit 6-18 subject to the conditions attached to the staff 
report as Exhibit A. 

SUMMARY 
The applicant is requesting a conditional use permit to increase the allowable height from 
twelve feet to sixteen feet to accommodate two additional future businesses that would be 
located to the east of the approved Arco AM/PM Market and Fuel Station, 1646 Highway 99. 

SITE DESCRIPTION 
The subject site is an approximately 2.74 acre parcel located on the east side of Highway 99 
south of Hazel Street. The use of the surrounding properties is commercial adjacent to the 
west, north and south boundaries with single family residential also located to the north. The 
parcel is contiguous to Fairview Street at the east property boundary.

The AM/PM Arco development was approved by both the Planning Commission and the City 
Council. The owner has advised staff that the property to the east will be developed as 
discussed at the public hearings and proposes the monument sign be allowed to be four feet 
taller to accommodate two additional businesses that would be developed on the remainder of 
the site. The code restricts the height of monument signs along the Highway 99 corridor to 
twelve feet. 

If the conditional use permit were not granted, it is likely that more monument signage would 
be approved along with directional signage to new businesses on this site. It makes good sense 
to be forward thinking and to create one monument sign to accommodate the approved use as 
well as potential future businesses. 

PUBLIC NOTICE 
Notices were mailed to the surrounding property owners within a 300-foot radius of the subject 
site. A notice was also published in the Gridley Herald, posted at City Hall, and on the city 
website. At the time this report was prepared, no comments had been received.

August 8, 2018 Planning Commission Meeting 

Public Hearing: Item 6D - Conditional Use Permit 6-18 

FINDINGS 
The Planning Commission is required to make the following Findings of Fact for quasi-judicial 
actions of which this is. 

Conditional Use Permit Findings: 

1.  The proposed use is in accordance with the objectives of the Commercial General Plan 

land use designation and General Commercial (C-2) zoning district. 
Approval of a conditional use permit will allow the sign to be increased in height; therefore 
this finding can be made. 

2.  That the establishment, maintenance, or operations of the use applied for will not, under 

the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, 
comfort and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such 
proposed use. 
The commercial use of the property with a monument sign four additional feet in height 
will not be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, comfort and general welfare of persons 
residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed use; therefore this finding can be 
made. 

3.  That the use will not be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the 

neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city or substantially impede enactment of 
the comprehensive plan. 
The commercial use of the property with a monument sign four feet taller than allowed by 
the Gridley Municipal Code will not be detrimental or injurious to property and 
improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city or substantially 
impede enactment of the comprehensive plan; therefore this finding can be made. 

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW 
The proposed project is categorically exempt from environmental review pursuant to the 
California Environmental Quality Act, Section 15311, Accessory Structures, Class 11. 

CONCLUSION 
Approving a conditional use to allow a four foot monument sign height increase will not be 
detrimental, does not constitute a precedent and will function to limit additional signage for 
future businesses.
