Subject: 

Tentative Subdivision Map No. 1-19;  Application for a tentative subdivision 
map to subdivide three parcels consisting of approximately 4.7 acres into 
twenty-one (21) parcels consisting of one 0.25 acre parcel for a detention basin 
and twenty (20) parcels for a residential housing development located at the 
northeast corner of Peach Street and West Biggs Gridley Road in the Single 
Family Residential District (R-1) and Residential, Low Density (RLD) General Plan 
land use designation. (APN: 022-230-022, -024 & -025) 

Recommendation 
City staff respectfully recommends the Planning Commission: 

1.  Determine the project is Categorically Exempt per the California Environmental 

Quality Act, Section 15332(a-e), Class 32, Infill Development Projects; and, 
Recommend approval of TSM 1-19 to the City Council. 

2. 

Summary 
The applicant is proposing a 21-parcel single-family residential subdivision on three 
parcels totaling ±4.7 acres. The proposed subdivision was initially proposed and 
approved in 1993 and 2005; both maps expired. The applicant is submitting a similar 
proposal as previously approved with slight differences in lot sizes, the connection to 
Bridgeford Avenue for future growth to the north. 

Discussion 
Background 
The subject site is located at the east side of West Biggs Gridley Road, north of Peach 
and Ohio Streets and south of a proposed extension of Bridgeford Avenue. The site is 
currently vacant with existing vegetation of shrubs and trees. The tentative subdivision 
map will create 20 new single-family lots ranging in size from 5, 050 to 6,565 square 
feet and one lot reserved for a storm water detention basin 11,200 square feet. 

I nnd IISP 
The project site is zoned R-1, Single Family Residential District and has a General Plan land use 
designation of Residential, Low Density. The single-family residential district has four (4) 
designations: 

1.  R-1A Parcels sized from 1,700 — 3,500 square feet 
2.  R-1B Parcels sized from 3,501— 5,999 square feet 
3.  R1-C Parcels sized from 6,000 — 7,499 square feet 
4.  R-1 

Parcels sized from 7,500 and greater 

The proposed development will have seventeen (17) R-16 and three (3) R-1C parcels. One 
parcel is reserved for the detention basin. This proposed layout has a gross density of 
approximately 4.25 du/acre. The R-1 designation allows 4 du/ac and this proposal meets the 
intent of the zoning density. 

The development of the three parcels into 21 meets the General Plan land use 
designation and the programs. Additionally, the Housing Element of the General Plan 
supports smaller lot subdivisions and infill development to help meet the housing 
requirement for the City of Gridley. The Housing Element Policy HP-2.4 also supports 
this development: 

"The City will encourage infill development in meeting the housing needs 
required by expanding populations." 

Public Notice 
A notice was posted in the Gridley Herald 10 days in advance of the Planning Commission 
meeting, posted at City Hall, made available at the Administration public counter, and placed 
on the City website for review. At the time this report was prepared no comments had been 
received. 

Environmental Review 
Staff has determined the project to be categorically exempt in accordance with Section 
15332 of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA): 
a) 

The project is consistent with the applicable General Plan designation and all 
applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation 
regulations. 
The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more 
than 5 acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. 
The project has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species. 

c) 
d)  Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to 

b) 

traffic, noise, air quality, orwater quality. 
The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.

PUBLIC HEARINGS 

A. 

Conditional Use Permit No. 1-18; Application for a conditional use permit to allow 
residential use in an existing building located at 912 Hazel Street in the Limited 
Commercial/Downtown Mixed Use Combining Zone (C-1/DMU) and Commercial 
General Plan land use designation. (APN: 009-161-021) 

1. 

Receive staff report —Donna Decker provided an overview of the staff report for the 
application of the conditional use permit for an existing building located at 912 Hazel 
Street in the Limited Commercial/Downtown Mixed Use Combining Zone (C-
1/DMU) and Commercial General Plan land use designation. She reported this was 
brought to the Planning Commission because it is a single-story building. She 
explained that previously the Gridley Municipal Code was amended to allow 
residential use in the limited commercial zoning district for residential on the second 
floor and the amendment unintentionally omitted the opportunity for residential if 
the building only had one floor. Therefore, that is why it is before the Commission. 
She elaborated as to the square footage of the building (3,036 square feet.), square 
footage intended to be used for residential (750 square feet). Decker reviewed the 
staff recommendations as listed on the staff report, conditional use permit findings, 
public notice information. She added that although no public written comments 
were received, she has had some telephone conversations with concerns of the 
project. The concerns were not about the residential aspect but other ongoing issue 
may be involved with the application. Decker further clarified to Commission this 
item is to simply make a determination on the land use and is not an issue with the 
applicant unrelated to land use or litigious litigation. After discussions with 
concerned parties there was a phone call received that there were no further 
concerns from moving forward with the land use. She closed her presentation with 
final review of the conditions of approval. 

Open public hearing—Chairman Wise opened the public hearing. 

Hear public testimony — No public testimony given. 

4. 

Close public hearing —Chairman Wise closed the public hearing. 

Commission discussion -There was Planning Commission discussion regarding the 
process for the future applicants requesting residential use in the downtown 
district. There was lengthy discussion relating to parking requirements, health and 
safety codes, and enforcement of the health and safety codes. Decker provided 
clarification of business license code enforcements, safety codes and inspections 
with Butte County Building Department and CalFire for fire sprinkler inspections. 

Planning Commissioner Ishrat Khan-Aziz announced she had a concern with health 
and safety of the business. She was walking by and noticed there were three or 
four notices on the door and today she was driving by and saw a sheriff officer 
knocking on the door. She expressed concerns of the applicant compliance with 

the building department building codes such as a fire wall and safety of the 
building. Khan inquired what agency would be responsible to ensure the applicant 
is complying with all requirements. Ms. Decker explained the applicant would be 
required to comply with all building code requirements required by the Butte 
County Building Dept. The Gridley Electric Department would be inspecting and 
evaluating all electrical issue requirements and the Fire Departmnt for the 
sprinkler and fire safety inspections. Ms. Decker clarified that the property owner 
and/or business owner which is the applicant is ultimately responsible for the 
building and the property and if all requirements are not met, she will not be able 
to reside at the property. 

Vice Chairman Maria Espino reported she had additional concerns pertaining to 
the intended use of the facility. She referenced wording on the Conditional Use 
Permit Findings #3 which states "that the use will not be detrimental or injurious 
to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of 
the city or substantially impede enactment of the comprehensive plan". She 
reported the proposed use will not bring people downtown and is not benefiting 
the downtown area. She ínquired if there was a list of business uses for the 
downtown area because felt this did not benefit the downtown area. Ms. Decker 
explained the decision before Commission was related to whether or not to allow 
residential use on a single-story building in the downtown area. As for the use of 
the business which is a Home Town Clinic, medical use is permitted in the 
downtown area (C-1 & C-2 zones). If the Commission wanted to only designate 
retail uses in the downtown areas, the Commission would need to entertain 
amending the Gridley Code to exclude those uses other than retail. 

Wise reported the City did need to take into consideration as to how saturated the 
area becomes with residential uses and causes problems with parking for other 
businesses. Ms. Decker concurred and acknowledged that requiring that 
applicants/property owners apply for a conditional use permit for residential uses 
in the downtown area would be one way to try and control the amount of 
residential area is utilized by each applicant. 

Commissioner Espino reiterated their concerns of the business use because it 
appears that the business is vacant and not a benefit to the Downtown Business 
District which conflicts with Conditional Use Permit Finding #3. Khan expressed the 
County has limited control that is much less than when the City had their own 
building department. Ms. Decker clarified the findings are based on the general 
plan use that allows residential use in a single story located in zone C-1/C-2 not the 
nature of the business which is not bringing in pedestrian traffic. After brief 
discussion between the Commission, as to the business use of the property and 
further deliberation, a motion was made.

Receive staff report —Donna Decker, Planning Consultant cited staff report. Decker

approximately 2.81 acre parcel into two parcels consisting of one 0.97 acre parcel and one 1.84 
acre parcel located at 1646 Highway 99 in the General Commercial (C-1) and Commercial General 
Plan land use designation. (APN: 010-210-057) 

City staff respectfully recommends the Planning Commission: 

Receive staff report —Donna Decker, Planning Consultant cited staff report. She 
noted a correction of General C-2 zoning along the highway. She explained the 
intent of the applicant Jatinder Kullar, applied for a Tentative Parcel Map in order to 
subdivide the existing parcel into two parcels in order to lease a portion of the site 
to AM/PM and holding the other parcel for future development. The site 
development plan was approved by the Planning Commission and the City Council. 
Plans are currently under review for building permit issuance and a demolition 
permit has been issued for the existing structure. She reviewed the site location, 
approximately 2.81 acre parcel located on the east side of Highway 99 south of Hazel 
Street. The use of the surrounding properties is commercial adjacent to the west, 
north and south boundaries with single family residential also located to the north. 
The parcel is contiguous to Fairview Street at the east property boundary. She closed 
with recommendations to approve the tentative parcel map and reviewed in detail 
with Commissioners the attached conditions of approval, exhibit "A" and parcel 
easements. 

Open public hearing —Chairman Wise opened the public hearing. 

3. 

Hear public testimony - The applicant, Jatinder Kullar inquired if the City was going 
to maintain the city easements. Decker clarified what areas the City would maintain 
but clarified the property owners are responsible to pick up trash and pedestrian 
debris. 

Jatinder Kullar concurred and stated he would be cleaning and keeping up with the 
property. He was confused with the traffic stop light Caltrans requirements. Staff 
clarified stoplight and paint striping requirements from Caltrans. There was a 
question relating to the 65 ft. easement from parcel 1. 

Parm Parnbinning, 1607 Highway 99 asked if the 9.7 acres remaining was that after 
the 65 ft. easement has been taken out. Donna Decker, Planníng Commissioner 
referred to the parcel 1 & 2 map reviewed the access easement being created for 
entry from Sycamore onto the site. 

Nicole Ledford, Project Engineer from NorthStar Designing Solutions, Chico Ca. 
approached the Commission and reported she has assisted with the map, 
recommended to allow the easements (65 & 30 ft) to be made as public service 
easements they allow for walkways to be constructed in those areas but are 
technically a public walkway, but its not considered a public access therefore it 
allows for utilities and vehicular traffic to go though. Planning Consultant, Donna 
Decker stated she does not have an answer to that question yet, however, she will 
include additional wording on the conditions of approval #6, 8, and 9 "as required 
by the City Engineer" that way there can be additional future discussion. Mr. Kullar 
inquired what did changing those easements to for the future development. Ledford 
responded they could have private access as long as it is approved by the City in the 
construction process plans for the development. It would not be a public access 
unless it is requested and dedicated as public, additional access could be added in 
the future, both front and rear parcels would be subject to the same review process. 
Donna Decker, Planning Consultant reported she could not confirm that the City 
Engineer would allowed those as public service easements, however through the 
site development plan review process they could still require a public access 
easement. Therefore, adding the additional verbiage would allow flexibility. 

4. 

Close public hearing —Chairman Wise closed the public hearing. 

Commission discussion —The Planning Commission held lengthy discussion 
pertaining to the conditions and additional clarification from Staff. They reviewed

B. 

Conditional Use Permit No. 4-18;  Application for a conditional use permit to allow residential 
use in the General Commercial (C-2) zoning district located at 118 Sycamore Street. 
(APN: 010-152-013) 

Receive staff report —Donna Decker, Planning Consultant announced that this item #B 
4-18 (as well as #C 5-18) is similar to item #A 3-18 which require a Conditional use 
permit. The applicant is requesting a conditional use permit in order to continue the use 
of the property as an existing single-family residence in the General Commercial (C-2) 
zoning district. The property was developed with single family residential uses in the 
late 1920's. This property was rezoned along the Highway 99 commercial corridor 
although it was still being used as single family residential. Without the Conditional Use 
Permit, the owner would not be able to replace the unit if damage were to occur, or to 
make improvements. 

Donna Decker explained the applicant asked for a separate conditional use permit that 
they be allowed to use the property as a residential addiction recovery facility for up to 
6 full time residents in a single family residential unit. Decker stated she provided 
additional information to the Commission relating to select California laws and 
regulations relating to residential recovery facilities and group homes. She stated the 
City is not allowed to condition or restrict the use only in single family districts for 6 
people or fewer. There are only regulations on the occupants based on sq. footage. She 
clarified the use cannot restrict the use should it be zone R1. She stated there were 
questions distributed prior to meeting submitted by Chair Espino regarding licensing, 
inspections allowed by the City, time constraints on use and filing of complaints process. 
She reviewed the questions and responses to the Commission relating to use of the R1 
zoning. She did report David Burke is affiliated with Orchard Hospital with the 
transitional recovery program, use and licenses are governed by the State of California. 
If complaints are received the City can look into any complaints, however the State of 
California oversees the licensing. Decker reiterated the City would be involved in 
ensuring the electric service for site would be appropriate. Decker closed her 
presentation with referencing the law exhibit relating to addition facilities and she did 
not anticipate any concerns wíth the facility location for the proposed use. 

2. 

Open public hearing —Chair Espino opened the public hearing. 

Hear public testimony -Dave Burke approached the Planning Commission and 
provided a verbal information presentation as to what type of recovery would be 
assigned to the site, other sites that have been successful, transitional housing, 
partnerships with hospital and treatment facilities, treatment timeline, and how 
important it is to be transparent as to the expectations of having a treatment facility 
located in that area as well as exploring other areas. Burke closed with standards 

of the proposed facilities, patient brokering, ethics committees, each house being 
certified, non-profit fundraisers for veterans, and his experience in working with 
colleagues with the medical and social model of rehab centers. Bob King, applicant 
reported this facility would be a positive program for the Community because there 
is a problem with drug abuse in this County. They do not want to create a problem 
for neighbors but provide assistance to those who need transitional housing that 
have already been sober. They can try to find another area but they would like to 
do something for the Community. Some of the neighbors have expressed they don't 
believe it is a good location and he respects their opinion. They will continue to 
explore areas for transitional housing for recovery. 

Jerry Davis, 154 Sycamore St., inquired why no one has knocked on her door. After 
hearing the programs, she didn't have a problem with 90 day sober program that 
help veterans and there is a need but had a concern that if there is problems with 
the site who shuts it down. She closed by stating she was not opposed or in favor 
of the site however would like information as to the involvement the City/State 
has with controlling the site. 

Ed Becker, 179 Sycamore Street, approached Commission addressed Orchard is 
not affiliated with Burke but will be working closely with him, social workers and 
physicians. He reported that conditions in the use permit cannot be override by 
the City should the use permit be R-1. When the use permit is issued it runs with 
the land regardless of the operator. It would be up to the State to close the facility. 
He clarified he does not oppose the program, cautioned with use permit, and is 
impressed with having this type of facility in the City because there is a need. 

Close public hearing —Chair Espino closed the public hearing. 

Commission discussion —Espino confirmed this discussion for both items #B & #C. 
There was lengthy discussion among Planning Commission relating to the recovery 
program and partnerships between Mr. Burke and Orchard Hospital, types of 
rehabilitations that would be included in the program. Wise expressed he was not 
concerned with the proposed location and felt the housing would be adequate 
with proposed applicants. There was discussion of source of funding for these 
facilities, enhancements to the programs responsible parties overseeing the 
program, rehab success rates, program timelines for residents, type of residents 
(do not have 290's, criminals or sex offenders), it is strictly recovery transitional 
housing for applicants that have been in the program and are considered sober 
and spoke about core family values are incorporated in the programs. After 
lengthy discussion and information obtained in the Public Hearing from Burke the 
Commission was not opposed to the structured programs and health partnerships 
services and the location of proposed site. The concurred that there is a need in 
the community.

D. Conditional Use Permit No. 6-18;  Application for a conditional use permit a allow a height 

increase from twelve feet to sixteen feet for a monument sign in the General Commercial (C-2) 
zoning district located at 1646 Highway 99.(APN: 010-210-057) 

City staff respectfully recommends the Planning Commission: 

Receive staff report —Staff report reviewed by Donna Decker, Planning Consultant, 
it was notice and no comments or concerns were recieved. The applicant is 
requesting a conditional use permit to increase the allowable height from twelve 
feet to sixteen feet to accommodate two additional future businesses that would 
be located to the east of the approved Arco AM/PM Market and Fuel Station, 1646 
Highway 99. The AM/PM Arco development was approved by both the Planning 
Commission and the City Council. The owner has advised staff that the property to 
the east will be developed as discussed at the public hearings and proposes the 
monument sign be allowed to be four feet taller to accommodate two additional 
businesses that would be developed on the remainder of the site. The code restricts 
the height of monument signs along the Highway 99 corridor to twelve feet. If the 
conditional use permit were not granted, it is likely that more monument signage 
would be approved along with directional signage to new businesses on this site. It 
makes good sense to be forward thinking and to create one monument sign to 
accommodate the approved use as well as potential future businesses.
