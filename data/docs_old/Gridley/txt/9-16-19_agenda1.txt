Summary 
On July 10, 2019, the Planning Commission considered the request to develop the 
three parcels into twenty-one parcels to create a residential subdivision.  One of the 
parcels would be reserved for a storm water detention basin.   
 
Mr. Patrick Coghlan, 852 Idaho Street, provided public testimony in opposition to the 

condition of approval allowing a deferment of the road improvements on West Biggs 
Gridley Road from the intersection of Peach and West Biggs Gridley Road to the north 
property line.  He stated that the City had required Heron Landing to put all of the 
improvements in.  He noted that if they are not put in now and deferred to a later date, 
there was no guarantee that they would be put in at all.  He also noted that it would 
create a dangerous situation for pedestrians in the subdivision and children who may 
walk to school who would not have a sidewalk as a safe refuge out of traffic.  
Additionally, he felt there should be fencing placed around the detention basin to keep 
people out of the facility. With regard to traffic, he questioned the reason why a 
deceleration lane was not being provided into the subdivision. Refer to Exhibit G.  
 
The Planning Commission supported the project with the following amendments to the 
Conditions of Approval: 
 

14. Dedicate the east one-half of West Biggs-Gridley Road and enter into an 

improvement deferment agreement attached to all properties in the subdivision 
with the exception of lot 21, to pay the costs at a future date when West Biggs-
Gridley Road will be designed and constructed.   As construct all of the road and 
utility improvements as required consisting of curb, gutter, sidewalk, pole 
relocation, and landscaping and irrigation in accordance with the City of Gridley 
Public Works standards.  
 

26. If a fence is required around the detention basin, it shall be an ornamental fence 

reviewed and approved by the Planning Department.  

 
The Planning Commission directed staff to work with the applicant to develop an Engineer’s 
estimate of the costs that would be deferred. 
 
The applicant requests the City Council allow the deferment of improvements on West Biggs 
Gridley Road.  An Engineer’s Estimate was provided the Planning Department calculates the 
cost of the improvements to be approximately $357,420 (Exhibit C).  The applicant proposes 
the City allow the cost to be distributed to each of the twenty parcels.  The cost per each of the 
twenty parcels would be approximately $17,871.  This could be an assessed cost and paid by 
homeowners over a time period acceptable to the City until such time the City and County work 
together to reconstruct West Biggs Gridley Road with all improvements.   

 

Discussion 
The applicant is proposing a 21-parcel single-family residential subdivision on three 
parcels totaling ±4.7 acres.  The proposed subdivision was initially proposed and 
approved in 1993 and 2005; both maps expired.   The applicant is submitting a similar 
proposal as previously approved with slight differences in lot sizes, the connection to 
Bridgeford Avenue for future growth to the north.   
 
 

 

Page 2 of 8 

Background 
The subject site is located at the east side of West Biggs Gridley Road, north of Peach 
and Ohio Streets and south of a proposed extension of Bridgeford Avenue. The site is 
currently vacant with existing vegetation of shrubs and trees.  The tentative subdivision 
map will create 20 new single-family lots ranging in size from 5, 050 to 6,565 square 
feet and one lot reserved for a storm water detention basin 11,200 square feet.  
 
Land Use 
The project site is zoned R-1, Single Family Residential District and has a General Plan land use 
designation of Residential, Low Density.  The single-family residential district has four (4) 
designations: 

1.  R-1A  Parcels sized from 1,700 – 3,500 square feet 
2.  R-1B  Parcels sized from 3,501 – 5,999 square feet 
3.  R-1C  Parcels sized from 6,000 – 7,499 square feet 
4.  R-1 

Parcels sized from 7,500 and greater 

 
The proposed development will have seventeen (17) R-1B and three (3) R-1C parcels. One 
parcel is reserved for the detention basin.  This proposed layout has a gross density of 
approximately 4.25 du/acre.   The R-1 designation allows 4 du/ac and this proposal meets the 
intent of the zoning density.  
 
The  development  of  the  three  parcels  into  21  meets  the  General  Plan  land  use 
designation and the programs.  Additionally, the Housing Element of the General Plan 
supports  smaller  lot  subdivisions  and  infill  development  to  help  meet  the  housing 
requirement for the City of Gridley.  The Housing Element Policy HP-2.4 also supports 
this development:  
 

“The  City  will  encourage  infill  development  in  meeting  the  housing  needs 
required by expanding populations.”  

 
Deferred Improvements 
Staff recommended condition number 14 to allow the deferment of road improvements, 
sidewalks, irrigation and landscaping because the construction of such improvements may 
hamper future road design to have positive drainage.  The construction of improvements that 
would create a second design point to meet that is approximately 680 linear feet distant from 
the Heron Landing improvements could possibly limit an effective design.   
 
In order to fund the improvements at a later date, to be determined by the City, an assessment 
district would be formed to provide funding for street lighting, the sewer lift station, storm 
drainage detention basin and the frontage improvements.  While the assessment for the other 
components would be ongoing, the City would set a specific time frame for payoff of the 
frontage improvements and would allow payment in full during the assessed payment period.  
 
City staff believe the provision for the frontage improvements be constructed at a future date 
will ensure better design at the appropriate time when the West Biggs Gridley Road will be 

 

Page 3 of 8 

improved and drainage determined in a comprehensive approach.   The conditions of approval 
will be modified upon decision by the City Council.   

Public Notice 
A notice was posted in the Gridley Herald 10 days in advance of the City Council meeting, and 
notices were mailed to all property owners within 300 feet of the project boundary, posted at 
City Hall, made available at the Administration public counter, and placed on the City website 
for review.  At the time this report was prepared no comments had been received.  

Environmental Review 
Staff has determined the project to be categorically exempt in accordance with Section 
15332 of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA):  
a)

The project is consistent with the applicable General Plan designation and all
applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation
regulations.
The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more
than 5 acres substantially surrounded by urban  uses.
The project has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species.
Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to
traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. 
The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.

Financial Impact 
There are no direct or indirect costs to the City excepting the management of the assessment 
district formed. 

Compliance with City Council Strategic Plan or Budget Goals 
This recommendation is consistent with the ongoing effort to be responsive and transparent 
regarding all financial matters.

LAND USE DESIGNATION.  (APN: 022-230-022, -024 & -025) 

WHEREAS, the City of Gridley has received an application to consider a Tentative 
Subdivision Map request for one parcel totaling approximately 4.7 acres in order to create 
a total of twenty-one lots for future single-family residential use on property located 
generally east of West Biggs Gridley Road and north of Peach Street in the manner 
illustrated on a tentative parcel map received by the City (Exhibit "A" attached); and, 

 
WHEREAS, the subject property consists of three parcels designated as Assessor's 

Parcel Number 022-230-022, -024 & -025 and the proposed Tentative Subdivision Map has 
been assigned the file number Tentative Subdivision Map No. 1-19 (TSM 1-19); and, 

 
 WHEREAS, the existing General Plan designation is Residential, Low Density on 

the Gridley Land Use Map; and, 

 
WHEREAS, the existing zoning designation for the subject parcel is R-1 Single 

Family Residential District; and, 

 
WHEREAS, the City Council finds that Tentative Subdivision Map No. 1-19, including the 

proposed use and improvements to the property, is consistent with Gridley's General Plan 
including the policies contained therein as well as the land use diagram, and also finds that 
based on the conditions of approval, the site is physically suitable for development as 
proposed; and, 

 
WHEREAS, the City Council considered at a noticed public hearing on September 16, 

2019, the comments and concerns of property owners who are potentially affected by 
approval of Tentative Subdivision Map No. 1-19, and also considered City staff’s report 
regarding the proposed tentative map design and required public improvements; and, 

 
WHEREAS, the City Council determined that the described tentative map and its design 
and improvements are consistent with Gridley's General Plan and zoning ordinance policies 
regarding the use and division of land; and, 

 
WHEREAS, the City Council, having further considered the project and determined the 

project to be categorically exempt in accordance with Section 15332 of the California

a) 

 
b) 

The project is consistent with the applicable General Plan designation 
and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning 
designation regulations. 

 The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of 
no more than 5 acres substantially surrounded by urban  uses. 

The project has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species. 

Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating  
to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality.  

 
c) 
 
d) 
 
 
e) 
 
WHEREAS, the City Council finds that this tentative subdivision map complies with 
all  State  and  City  regulations  governing  the  division  of  land,  and  that  division  and 
development of the property in the manner set forth on the tentative parcel map as shown 
on  Exhibit  A will not unreasonably interfere with the  free  and  complete  use  of existing 
public and/or public utility easements or rights-of-way. 

The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services. 

 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  BE  IT  RESOLVED  BY  THE  CITY  COUNCIL  OF  THE  CITY  OF 

GRIDLEY, AS FOLLOWS: 

 

SECTION 1: FINDINGS FOR APPROVAL OF THE TENTATIVE SUBDIVISION MAP 
 
1.  The proposed project is consistent with the City of Gridley General Plan Land Use    

Element.  

2.  The site is physically suitable for the type of development proposed. The project site is 

flat with slopes less than two percent. The project site within the Gridley urban limits and 
is not within a flood plain. There is adequate road access to the property. All necessary 
public utilities and services necessary for development are available to the site. 
 

3.  The site is physically suited for the density of development. The R-1 zone district 

allows for the development of single-family residential dwelling units on lots from:  
 

•  R-1A  Parcels sized from 1,700 – 3,500 square feet 
•  R-1B  Parcels sized from 3,501 – 5,999 square feet 
•  R-1C  Parcels sized from 6,000 – 7,499 square feet 
•  R-1 

Parcels sized from 7,500 and greater 

 

The proposed development will have seventeen (17) R-1B and three (3) R-1C parcels. One 
parcel is reserved for the detention basin.  This proposed layout has a gross density of 
approximately 4.25 du/acre.   The R-1 designation allows 4 du/ac and this proposal meets 
the intent of the zoning density.  

4.  The design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are not likely to cause 

serious public health problems. As conditioned, the project will provide adequate 
sanitary sewer, a public water supply, storm drainage facilities, and Standard 
subdivision road improvements which will include fire hydrants, streetlights and 
roadways designed for residential traffic. 
 

5.   The Tentative Subdivision Map conforms to the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act 

and to the provisions of Gridley Municipal Code Title 16- Subdivisions. 
 

6.  The tentative subdivision map complies with the required form and content of tentative 

subdivision maps, as set forth by the City and based upon the provisions of Title 16 of 
the Gridley Municipal Code. 
 

7.  The tentative parcel map is consistent with good planning and engineering practice. The 

City Engineer has reviewed the tentative subdivision map, and has attached terms and 
conditions hereby incorporated within the Conditions of Approval.

Program to Manage Unclaimed Cats  

Subject: 
 
 
Recommendation 
Staff respectfully requests the City Council consider and authorize the program to manage 
unclaimed cats in the City of Gridley.   
 
Background 
Animal Control services are overburdened with feral and community cat issues.  Community 
cats are defined as cats not belonging to anyone while typically being fed by the neighborhood. 
Feral and community cats have been an ongoing issue that current methods are ineffective and 
do not provide any long-term solutions.  Simply removing these cats only provides a short-term 
reduction of the population due to the breeding process will quickly replace any reductions.  
 
The City’s Animal Control Officer has reached out to other communities and organizations in 
order to find a more effective solution to this problem.  Trap Neuter and Replace programs 
have been the most effective and successful methods to ensure the health of well-being of 
other cats that are actually owned and cared for by loving families.  The program involves 
placing traps out at specific dates which coordinate with a spay and neuter clinic.  After 
captured feral and community cats are spayed and neutered, they are immediately released 
back out to the community.  The TNR program is used with success in other communities and 
has been a proven effective method to control the population of feral and community cats.  The 
TNR program also provides for a healthier cat population as well as reduces public problems 
that associate with cat breeding. 
 
The program functions best with community education, participation and fundraising.  The 
average cost per cat is approximately $55.00 each.   
 
Financial Impact
