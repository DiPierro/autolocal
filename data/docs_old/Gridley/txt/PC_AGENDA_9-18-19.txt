1. 

Receive staff report 

Staff report —Donna Decker reviewed the staff report and plans as submitted to 
Commission. She explained the differences in previous plans (originally submitted 
in 1993) and changes since the first submittal of the map. She explained the 
applicant is proposing a 21-parcel single-family residential subdivision on three 
parcels (4.7 acre). The proposed subdivision was initially proposed and approved in 
1993 and 2005; both maps expired. The applicant is submitting a similar proposal 
as previously approved with slight differences in lot sizes, the connection to 
Bridgeford Avenue for future growth to the north. The tentative subdivision map 
will create 20 new single-family lots ranging in size from 5, 050 to 6,565 square feet 
and one lot reserved for a storm water detention basin 11,200 sq. ft. She elaborated 
as to revised zoning codes and purpose to support infill design and legalize small 
parcels in town. She explained the City reduced lot sized and allowed for smaller lot 
designations under R1 zoning. She reviewed exhibit "A" Conditions of Approval and 
map as well as discussing the variety of zones and lot sizes within the map, proposed 
sidewalk improvements and deferred improvements as well as standards that need 
to be made for this subdivision. She closed that this is an opportunity for 
Commission to make recommendations to bring to City Council of this project. The 
project is categorically exempt and no environmental impacts. 

Chairwoman Espino and Vice Chairman Wolfe asked for clarification of deferred 
sidewalk improvements. Decker reported it was for curb and gutter (north to south 
areas of the project with landscaping only). Espino and Wolfe both expressed 
concerns with conditions relating to the City entering into a deferred agreement 
relating to improvements located on the east one-half of West Biggs Gridley Road 
and costs associated to the improvements be passed onto the future property 
owners of those parcels. They both elaborated as to when other subdivisions have 
built along West Biggs Gridley Road, the improvements were included. 

Commissioner Khan inquired if there are issues with archeological artifacts. Decker 
explained if found, the contractor is required to stop and inform the City and the 
owner will need to have an archeologist come out to the site. Decker reviewed the 
process of approval of the map and responsible parties for the project and 
development. Khan inquired what the term "slope" meant on the property map. 
Decker explained it's part of the drainage information for the lots. The grading plans 
and improvement plans will be further submitted. 

Chairwoman Espino inquired on the Bridgeford Ave proposed future street 
extension. Decker reviewed the future street extension (county) plan submittal and 
designation. She explained the future street extension on Bridgeford, required 
annexation due to county lines. The original proposal was not to have Glen Drive 
but due to safety personnel access concerns, this plan has been submitted. 

Espino inquired about #11 condition. Decker explained it is to keeping the dust 
down for Butte County Air Quality. There was further discussion between Decker 
and Espino relating to the City providing the same type of maintenance of districts 
such as those of Heron Landing. Decker concurred and explained the process of the 
deed lot 21, detentions, landscaping and streetlights, as well as frontage 
improvements. 

Commissioner Khan inquired if the building requirements included building to code 
for "earthquakes" criteria. Decker reported that they will need to meet the most 
current uniform building codes which include that criteria. 

2. 

Open the pubic hearing —Chairwoman Espino opened the public hearing. 

Kurt Hilbers —1555 Atkinson Ct., Yuba City, owner of Hilbers Inc. introduced himself 
to the Commíssion. He explained there is a lot of interest to build especially after 
Camp Fire Disaster and would like to see the project built. The difference between 
them and other builders is that the project this is a much smaller project. 
Chairwoman Espino ask about project timelines. Mr. Hilbers explained they are 
working on a smaller project in Gridley, so it would be fast and they anticipate to be 
under construction this summer. They have much larger projects in other cities, this 
is a small project and it would move fast. There was discussion between 
Chairwoman Espino and Vice Chairman Wolfe relating to the deferred development 
of improvements and if the new owners would be made aware ahead oftime before 
purchasing the project of those assessments. There was concern expressed of 
passing on the costs of the improvement to new homeowners. 

Decker explained the owners would be notified of deferred improvement costs. It is 
best to design the entire road vs a short entire section of the road. She explained 
the theory for deferring improvements to ensure design conformity. Wolfe 
expressed concern of future costs for improvements could change over time. 
Decker explained control points and improvements and elaborated as to designing 
of small sections, pockets done if not right there could be problems with funding to 
tear out and rebuild improvements. There would be disclosures provided to owners 
and options to set up an assessment district. 

Commissioner Khan ask Kurt Hilbers to confirm the other areas of improvements, 
lift station and retention basin. Mr. Hilbers confirmed per City Engineer and City 
requirements would have to be completed before homes are sold and all 
improvements should be in place and to code and prior to sale of homes. 

Pat Coghlan — 852 Idaho Street, addressed the Commission, submitted a written 
statement for the record (attached to minutes as "Exhibit A"). He provided a verbal 
overview of his written submittal, highlighting each concern. He asked the 
Commission to reconsider the allowance of deferred improvements. The deferment 
of improvements only provides savings of costs to the developer. It puts the burden 
on new homeowners, the City and/or County. He reported that all other builders 
have provided improvement upfront and allowing deferment of improvements 
makes the future property owners jump through hoops take on the burden that 
should be on the developer. He urged the Commission to reconsider. He added that 

that the detention pond calls for 6 ft cyclone fence with flats, that will look very 
unattractive. His primary concern was the safety issues with the plot plan. He 
deferred to other areas that are unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. He suggested 
have a safety engineer look at the plot plan because it is not safe and the City do not 
allow deferred improvements on West Biggs Gridley Road. 

There was brief overview of the map reassessing safety for pedestrians and cyclists. 
Decker reported if upon building the detention pond it is deep that would require 
fencing the instead of the cyclone fence it could be changed to an iron fence around 
Lot 21 detention basin with shrubbery. 

Close Public Hearing - Chairwoman Espino closed the public hearing. 

Commission Discussion -

4. 

Chairwoman Espino announced that new housing good idea for Gridley and Heron 
Landing Development has already set a standard to have improvements in place 
prior to the sale of homes. There will be more traffic and safety is a huge issue and 
she was not in support of the deferment of roadside improvements. She concluded 
she was in support of the development however, not the deferment of 
improvements along West Biggs Gridley Road as well as the extension to Bridgeford 
Street. 

Commissioner Khan announced she appreciated the interest in developing in 
Gridley but the sidewalk improvements should in place prior to the building of the 
development or if there is a deferment there should be a plan for deferred costs for 
future owners. There needs to be clarification for costs for proposal of deferred 
amounts to homeowners such as annual tax assessments. 

Vice Chairman Wolfe expressed concern with deferment of improvements along 
West Biggs Gridley Road. He was in support of new housing but not deferring costs 
to homeowners. 

Planning Consultant, Donna Decker suggested adding language to fencing 
conditions to the detention basin and deferment and cost plans. She explained the 
assessment process and plans.

conditions of approval; if the detention basin requires fencing, it will not be

Delivery by hand, July 10, 2019. 

In re: Tentative parcel map 1-19, Hilbers New Home Communities public hearing. 

Good Evening, 

My name is Patrick Coghlan. I reside at the above address and have done so since July, 1981. This 
proposed subdivision is one half block from my property and yesterday was the first time I learned of it. 
I have briefly reviewed the plot plan and I have several concerns about the project as presented to the 
Commission. I believe that the safe movement of pedestrians, bicyclists and vehicles in the area is 
unduly compromised by the current design. Here are my observations and concerns about this project: 

1. To me this project appears to propose that safety improvements to West Biggs-Gridley Road needed 
to accommodate Glenn Drive will not be completed as part of this project ("FUTURE STREET 
IMPROVEMENTS:  NAPO  THIS PROJECT"), that no deceleration lane or left turn lane provisions for cross 
streets will be incorporated into the project, and that the road width will be less than that incorporated 
into Heron Landing and Eagle Meadows subdivisions, and therefore unable to accommodate such safety 
provisions in the future. 

I ask you not accept these reduced standards and not compromise the safety of Gridley residents. We 
know that Biggs favors growth to its south on that road, that Gridley landowners along that road may 
also seek to build on their properties, that the railroad is against allowing additional at-grade crossings, 
and that overpasses are prohibitively expensive. As most of the traffic from Gridley subdivisions is 
southbound, and all the schools are southbound from the site, it is reasonable to expect that the 
majority of traffic from residential growth on this road will have to pass through this road section. 

After the exceptional job done by Heron Landing in accommodating expected growth, the last thing you 
should do is allow a pinch point to be created to accommodate this small development. The traffic on 
the road is definitely mixed use, in that in addition to residents it is used by farm vehicles and 
agricultural transport trucks, and is the dominant means by which police, fire and ambulance vehicles 
travel between Gridley and Biggs. When considering traffic safety simple residential standards are not 
effective and should not be relied upon. To keep this section of road safe I ask that the Gridley Planning 
Commission require road improvements which keep the same standards used for construction of Heron 
Landing and Eagle Meadows, and that they be completed prior to residential occupancy. 

2. The project proposes an extension of Idaho Street as its one and only southbound traffic artery. It is 
reasonable to expect nearly ali pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle traffic will be southbound towards 
highway 99, the city center, the shcpping center and the schools, and such traffic will cross Peach and 
Oak Streets before turning on Spruce or a street further south. This is a high risk route and should not be 
considered. 

Patrick J. Coghlan In re: Tentative Parcel Map 1-19, Gridley Planníng Commission, July 10, 2019 

Because Idaho Street is parallel to but only a little over 100 feet from West Biggs Gridley Road, these 
crossings are problematic for southbound motorized vehicles on Idaho crossing Oak, Spruce and streets 
further south as frequently cars turn east and do not have the time to react to a vehicle in the 
intersection. Pedestrians and bicyclists have an even worse problem as they take longer to cross the 
road. Crosswalks are impractical as motorists have too little warning after turning. If crosswalks were 
installed then a pedestrian crossing could result in a backup of vehicles onto Biggs Gridley Road. All it 
would take is one OTR truck to fill up the space between the crosswalk and the road. 

A further issue is the absence of sidewalks on Idaho Street. Currently most pedestrians on Idaho walk in 
the street. In winter muddy areas discourage use of the city right of way where the sidewalk should be. 

I ask the Commission to review the safety of the anticipated route for the residents of this subdivision, 
with special consideration for the safety of children walking or cycling to school, while mindful of the 
mix of vehicles going back and forth in the area. 

3. The proposed intersection of Peach Street and Idaho Street has all the problems outlined above for 
Oak, Spruce and Hazel, with two added problems. If you imagine you are a southbound pedestrian on 
Idaho Street in the subdivision and you are looking West to ascertain oncoming traffic while next to the 
fire hydrant at the northeast corner of the intersection, you will note that your ability to both see and 
hear the traffic which may be about to turn eastbound on Peach is impeded by a six foot sound wall. 
With today's hybrid and electric vehicles you will be unable to see or hear such traffic. A vehicle turning 
from Biggs Gridley Road to Peach will also be blinded to the intersection and, while trying to execute a 
safe !eft turn may have less than 100' to respond to pedestrian. At about 35 mph that vehicle can be in 
that intersection in about three seconds. I think that it is unthinkable to put anyone, especially our 
school children in such an unsafe predicament. I fear that many will not recognize the sensory 
deprivation and attempt to cross that road without due caution. A sizeable side yard setback for lot 1 
and elimination of the sound wall for that lot would be little relief. 

I also ask your attention to the existing stop sign in the northbound lane of Idaho at the intersection 
with Peach. I can tell you that in the last 37 years it has rarely been visible due to trees or motorhomes 
parked in front of it. (The current property owner has a low utility trailer there, and that has helped a 
lot.) As the intersection is currently a "T" it has not been much of a problem, but if Idaho is extended, a 
section will need to be red-curbed or some other remedy chosen to make it continuously visible. 

Thank you for your time. I encourage you to seek the guidance of a qualified traffic safety engineer in 
reviewing these issues. Please assist our community to grow but let's do so safely or not at all. 

Sincerely Yours, 

Patrick Coghlan

further elaborated as to setback requirements and designations and closed her 
verbal update summarizing the recommendations and stating that the request was 
not detrimental to the area. 

Open public hearing - Chair woman Espino opened the public hearing. 

Hear public testimony — Property Owner, Sunny Dhami, approached the 
Commission and provided a verbal update as to the request and added that the 
houses were being designed to match and blend in the existing neighborhood. 

Close public hearing —Chairwoman Espino closed the public hearing. 

Commission discussion -There was discussion among Planning Commissioners 
relating to the variance setbacks, review of the site described in the report, current 
land use designation and setback requirements under current code. There was 
brief overview of the conditions of approval "exhibit B" to the staff report. 
Planning Consultant Donna Decker reported that due to the irregular lot shape and 
desire to maximize the rear yard are limits the depth of the design to meet setback 
standards and review options available to the Commission for action. 

Commissioner S. Khan inquired as to the noticing of the variance. Consultant 
Decker reported the notice was posted in City Hall, published in the Gridley Herald 
ten days before the hearing and mailed to residences within 300 feet of the site. 
No concerns were received to date. 

Chairwoman Espino inquired if this type of variance request was common. 
Consultant Decker responded there have not been many requests as this is unique 
do to the irregular lot shape. She further clarified that it is a reasonable request 
because there is no impact to neighbors nor will it have a visual impact to the 
subdivision because it does not significantly encroach into the setback area. 

There was brief discussion between Commissioner S. Khan and Decker relating to 
any concerns for the request to increase the setbacks to the street. Decker 
provided a history of the design of the lots to explain further the request for 
variance.

Subject: 

Tentative Parcel Map No. 2-19;  Application for a tentative parcel map to 
subdivide one parcel consisting of approximately 5.4 acres into forty-two (42) 
parcels for a residential housing development located at the south side of 
Sycamore Street adjacent to Palm Drive in the Single Family Residential District 
(R-1) and Residential, Low Density (RLD) General Plan land use designation. 
(APN: 010-270-120) 

General Plan Amendment GPA 2-19, Rezone RZ 2-19; Application for a General 
Plan Amendment and Rezone of approximately 5.4 acres from the General Plan 
land use designation of Residential Suburban (RS) to Residential Low Density 
(RLD), and rezone from Residential Suburban (R-S) to Single Family Residential 
District (R-1) located at the south side of Sycamore Street adjacent to Palm 
Drive. (APN: 010-270-120) 

Recommendation 
City staff respectfully recommends the Planning Commission: 

1.  Recommend the City Council adopt a resolution accepting the Negative 

Declaration meeting the California Environmental Quality Act; and, 

2.  Recommend the City Council adopt a resolution and ordinance amending the 

General Plan and Rezone of the property; and, 
Recommend approval of TSM 2-19 to the City Council. 

Summary 
The applicant is proposing a 42-parcel single-family residential subdivision on a ±5.4 
gross acre parcel located on the south side of Sycamore Street, to the east of Palm 
Lane, and south of the Eagle Meadows Subdivision. The site had previously been 
considered for development; however, that approval expired. The applicant is applying 
for a different subdivision layout providing smaller lots, and the development of Palm 
Lane. 

Discussion 
Background 
The subject site is lócated at the south side of Sycamore Street, east of Palm Lane. The 
site is currently vacant. The tentative subdivision map will create a 42 small lot 
subdivision for new single-family residential units. This model will allow an affordable 
by design unit with two-story homes ranging from 1,900 square feet to 2,250 square 
feet.

Proposed subdivisionision 

FIGURE 1: Project Location 

Land Use 
The project site is zoned R-S, Residential Suburban District and has a General Plan land use 
designation of Residential, Very Low Density. The project applicant is requesting a General Plan 
Amendment and a rezone to conform to the Standard Single Family District (R-1) and the 
General Plan Land Use Designation of Residential, Low Density. The single-family residential 
district has four (4) designations: 

1.  R-1A Parcels sized from 1,700 — 3,500 square feet 
2.  R-1B Parcels sized from 3,501— 5,999 square feet 
3.  R1-C Parcels sized from 6,000 — 7,499 square feet 
4.  R-1 

Parcels sized from 7,500 and greater 

Page 2 of 9 

The purpose of changing the land use designation is to allow the project to comply without 
varying development standards so that future interpretations meet the code. The project could 
be accomplished by establishing a Planned Development Overlay where the land use could stay 
the same and the overlay zone would vary the development standards. Staff believes having 
straight zoning is advantageous. 

The R-1 zone allows 4 du/ac; however, the city established the four additional subzoning based 
on parcel size that increases the allowed density. This project would have an R-1A zoning 
allowing lots to be from 1,700 sf to 3,500 square feet. These designations were developed to 
legalize many of the older City of Gridley lots so that each lot became legal and could be 
upgraded and maintained. The proposal is designed to meet the demand for a standard single 
family home without large lot areas to maintain. This has become a model that is highly 
desirable and provides a different housing product for our community. 

The housing layout will be similar to the figure below: 

~

FIGURE 2: Housing Layout (Note this is not the same map as the Tentative Subdivision Map) 

The layout provides a look at how the homes will fit on the lots. There is adequate parking and 
the street is designed to meet our subdivision standards for residential street design. 

The Housing Element Policy HP-2.4 also supports this development: 

"The City will encourage infill development in meeting the housing needs 
required by expanding populations."

Driveways are provided for the residents to the west and south of the site. The road network 
provides access to the property to the south for future development. 

Approval process 

The approval process for subdivision maps are not discretionary in that the Planning 
Commission determines that the map meets the requirements of the Subdivision Map Act.
