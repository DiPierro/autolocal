Recommendation 
City staff respectfully requests that the City Council consider and approve revisïng the City's Position 
Classification Plan by reclassifying the Finance Business Service Supervisor position to the positíon of 
Assistant Finance Director and revising the salary range accordingly. 

Background 
The City of Gridley maintains a Position Classification Plan. In keeping with City Council direction, staff 
has reclassified the Finance Business Service Supervisor position to the Assistant Finance Director 
posítion. With the City Council's approval of this item, the Classification Plan will be formally revised to 
reflect this change. As Council is aware, the City Administrator has assumed the responsibilities ofthe 
Finance Director resulting in staff reduction ín the Finance Department. The recommended 
reclassification will result in additional oversight of the Finance Department, ensuring greater accuracy 
and customer service while at the same time reducing costs to tax payers and rate payers. As previously 
discussed with the City Council, the salary will be adjusted as described below.

Staff Report

To: 

Mayor and City Council 

From: 

Chief Allen Byers 

Subject: 

Police Vehicle Purchase 

X  Regular 
Special 
Closed 
Emergency 

Recommendation 
Staff respectfully requests the City Council consider and approve the purchase of a new Police Patrol 
vehicle to replace two older Patrol vehicles. 

Background 
The Department has discontinued using two of its existing Police Patrol units within the last six months 
due to breakdowns which would cost more to repair than feasible. Both vehicles have in excess of 130,000 
miles, placing them at the end of their useful life due to their aggressive use. Both vehicles will be used 
for parts to repair existing older vehicles as needed and will eventually be surplused in compliance with 
State law. 

The recommended replacement vehicle is a Ford Explorer Police Interceptor Hybrid. The additional cost 
of the hybrid will be easily recovered in fuel savings, additional warranty and extended life on the engine. 
The cost of the vehicle is $49,162.70 from Gridley County Ford. This Patrol unit is completely equipped. 
The only other item required is the Police radio. The price of the Patrol vehicle is at the government cost 
rate based upon a State discounted rate. 

Financial Impact 
There is no request for additional Departmental appropriations as the FY2019-20 Budget was approved 
by the City Council with $50,000 designated for purchase of a Patrol Vehicle. The City's COPS Program 
Budget has the necessary funding. 

Compliance with City Council Strategic Plan or Budget Goals 
This recommendation is consistent with our ongoing effort to be responsive and transparent regarding 
all business transactions and financial matters.

Subject: 

Consideration and Approval of Temporary Residential Housing Incentive Program #2 

Recommendation 
City staff respectfully requests that the City Council consider adoption of the attached Resolution No. 
2019-R-022 that supports implementation of the Temporary Residential Housing Incentive Program #2 
(TRHIP#2). The proposed Program is recommended to address the lingering and significant economic 
challenges of the 2008 National Financial Crisis. The Resolution authorizes the City Administrator to 
execute a program similar to the attached Temporary Residential Housing Incentive Program. 

Background 
The City Council adopted the Temporary Residential Housing Incentive Program #1 at the August 6, 2018 
Council meeting. Prior to that adoption the City Council previously received and reviewed a summary 
comparison of the City of Gridley's Development Impact Fees, including comparisons of nearby 
communities. The City`s Development Impact Fee (DIF) rates were adopted on February 20, 2007, 
utilizing a study from January, 2007 and further revised ín 2011. The Study included models established 
to collect costs of future projects based upon various master plans, reports, and studies. 

The Temporary Residential Housing Incentive Program #1 was very successful. The Program included a 
limited number of 45 permits with only 15 permits being available for any individual developer. If a 
Certificate of Occupancy is issued on or before December 31, 2021, the owner will receive the 75% 
reduction of impact fees including separate Sewer, Water, Electric, Police, Fíre, Parks, and Streets on 
residential units within the Gridley City Boundary. The Program does not affect the Gridley Unified 
School District Impact fee. Two developers have now used or reserved their allotment of 15 permits. 

The impact will be as follows on the average home or Equivalent Dwelling Unit: 

Total Current Impact Fees 

Total Proposed Temporary Fees 

$29,234.55 

$7,308.64 

The new proposed Temporary Residential Housing Incentive Program #2 (TRHIP#2) will include an 
increase per developer allotment to 30 Units. A total of 150 permits will be issued through the Program 
through December 31, 2022 with only 30 permits being available for any individual developer. If a 
Certificate of Occupancy is issued on or before December 31, 2022, the owner will receive the 75% 
reduction. Failure to receive a Certificate of Occupancy prior to January 1, 2023, will result in the 
requïrement to pay 100% of the City of Gridley DIF's, regardless of when the project began. After 
December 31, 2022, or sooner if the 150 permits are exhausted, a review by City Council may be 
performed to determine if any extension of the TRHIP Program is desired. 

Staff has conducted a study of various incentive policies/Programs used by other California cities. In 
October, 2013 the Governor signed AB562, which established regulations outlining the offering of 
economic development incentives by cities. The proposed Program documents were formulated to 
comply with A6562 and reflect the "Best Practices" throughout the State. 

While some areas of the City's economy have been recovering from the last recession, residential 
housing has continued to develop more slowly than pre-recession periods. The more limited 
construction of new residential, be it single ormulti-family, combined with a resale market impacted by 
underwater mortgages and lagging home values, has created adverse economic impact. 

Councilmembers and members of our community have consistently encouraged the City to pursue a 
temporary Program to incentivize residential construction in an attempt to address adverse economic 
issues. The goal of any temporary reduction in fees would be to stimulate the creation of new housing 
and create opportunities for new and varied levels of housing inventory throughout the City; to 
generate jobs in the construction industry; and ultimately increase local spending by homeowners who 
are outfitting their new homes. 

Fiscal Impact 
In any residential project, there are direct and indirect economic impacts. Direct economic impacts for 
the City represent fees and property tax revenue increases. 

Indirect impacts are more difficult to measure, so the City reviewed a 2010 study Analysis of the Fiscal 
and Economic Effects of New Housing Construction in California which was prepared for The California 
Housing Finance Agency. In the study, which was performed during the housing downturn, the authors 
estimated the total economic impact of a single family residential home is approximately $421,696 in 
the larger Bay Area. This figure incorporates not only construction material and jobs, but ancillary 
spending like moving companies and sales of furnishings and other items which occur when someone 
moves into a new home. The following chart illustrates the estimated economic impact of the Program 
using the economic impact information. The Gridley area cost of a home, using averages of $165 sq. 
feet and an average size of 1,800 sq. feet, results in average home value of $297,000. Using the data 
below, the overall costs of the TRHIP will be offset in less than five years.

INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITIONS 

Introduction 
Historically, the City of Gridley has enjoyed a reasonably strong housing market. However, the Great 
Recession coupled with the implementation of new Development Impact Fees has reduced new housing 
opportunities in Gridley. As a result, the City has developed the Temporary Residential Housing 
Incentive Program (TRHIP). The TRHIP is designed to stimulate private sector investment in the Gridley 
Housing Market with the goal of prudently growing our population, tax income, and job growth that are 
essential to maintaining a high quality of life for residents and businesses. The TRHIP impacts City of 
Gridley Impact Fees on residential units only. Fees under the jurisdiction of other agencies, including 
the Gridley Unified School District, are not associated with thïs Program 

Findings Required 
It is not the intent of this Program to divert funds from other communities. In compliance with 
Government Code sections 53084 and 53084.5, such incentives may not be offered to businesses that 
relocate their business from another city to Gridley. The Program is also not intended to be used to 
relocate a business from one location to another within the City. 

When applying any such efforts, the City must determine that the incentive is not a gift of public funds, 
and specific findings must be made. Therefore, the City Council must find that the incentives under this 
Program will advance the public welfare and provide adequate consideration in return to the City as 
follows: 

1.  The long-term net financial benefit to the public will exceed the value of the incentives 

provided; 

The residential projects will provide a direct public benefit through the generation of property, 
sales tax, and impact fees or other benefits to the City; 

3.  The incentives represent a partial return of revenues or fees that will be realized once the 

project is completed, such that the incentives will not impact the City's current General Fund 
balance as the incentives will be based on future, additional revenues to the General Fund. 

Definitions 
Eligible Applicant means an applicant who meets the eligibility requirements for a particular Program 
and excludïng any business that would trigger the requirements of Government Code sections 53084 
and 53084.5. 

Direct Public Benefits means benefits to the City and community which justify an incentive under this 
Program. 

TEMPORARY RESIDENTIAL HOUSING INCENTIVE PROGRAM 

Purpose 
While some areas of the Cíty's economy have been recovering from the last recessíon, residential 
housing has continued to develop more slowly than pre-recession periods. The more limited 
construction of new residential, be it single ormulti-family, combined with a resale market impacted by 
underwater mortgages and lagging home values, has created adverse economic impact. The lack of 
available quality and appealing housing ín the City is inciting employees of current or potential 
businesses to purchase or rent homes in adjoining communities, negatively impacting the City's overall 
economy. 

The City's Impact Fee structure has not reflected the needs of the current adverse marketplace and as a 
result there is little financial ability for the housing market to experience significant growth. City 
Councilmembers and area property owners have recommended the City pursue a temporary program to 
stimulate residential construction in an attempt to address these adverse economic issues. The current 
City Impact Fees per Equivalent Dwelling Unit (EDU) are as follows:

The goal of any temporary reduction in fees would be to incentivize the creation of new housing and 
create opportunities for new and varied levels of housing inventory throughout the Cíty; to generate 
jobs in the construction industry; and ultimately increase local spending by new homeowners who are 
outfitting their new homes. 

Proposed Proeram 
This Temporary Residential Housing Incentive Program (TRHIP) incentive program has been developed 
to address existing residential housing market challenges. The Program offers a 75% reduction to the 
City of Gridley's Impact Fees that include separate Sewer, Water, Electric, Police, Fire, Parks, and Streets 
Development Impact Fees (DIF's). The Program will include a limited number of participants. A total of 
150 permits will be issued through the Program through December 31, 2022. Only 30 permits would be 
available for any individual developer. 

If a Certificate of Occupancy for a residential unit is issued between September 3, 2019 and on or before 
December 31, 2022, the owner will receive the 75% reduction. Failure to receive a Certificate of 
Occupancy prior to January 1, 2023 will result in the requirement to pay 100% of the City of Gridley 
Development Impact Fees, regardless of when the project began. 

Financial Impact 
In any residential project, there are direct and índïrect economic impacts. Direct economic impacts for 
the City represent fees and property tax revenue increases. 

Indirect impacts are more difficult to measure, so the City reviewed a 2010 study Analysis of the Fiscal 
and Economic Effects of New Housing Construction in California which was prepared for The California 
Housing Finance Agency. In the study, which was performed during the housing downturn, the authors 
estimated the total economic impact of a single family residential home is approximately $421,696 was 
in the larger Bay Area. This figure incorporates not only construction material and jobs, but ancillary 
spending like moving companies and sales of furnishings and other items which occur when someone 
moves into a new home. The following chart illustrates the estimated economic impact of the 30 permit 
Program using the economic impact information. The Gridley area cost of a home, using averages of 
$165 sq. feet and an average size of 1,800 sq. feet, results in average home value of $297,000. Using the 
data below, the overall costs of the TRHIP will be offset in less than five years.
