City of Live Oak 

Report to City Planning Commission 

Meeting Date:  July 16, 2019 

Title:   Garden Glen Subdivision: Request for Reduction in Mitigation Fees 

Location:  Citywide 

Recommendation:    Review  and  pass  a  motion  forwarding  the  request  from  Reggie  Singh  
approving a City standard development agreement (attached as first exhibit) and with a reduction 
in mitigation fees for the Garden Glen Subdivision to the City Council with a recommendation of 
the following business points: 

Original property owner request: 

1.  A reduction of the City’s mitigation fees single family house from $32,347 to $24,541 for 

a reduction of $7806 per house for this 189 single family home subdivision. 

2.  The reduction in mitigation fees to be allowed within 48 months from the enactment of 

the written arrangement with the City.  

Recommendation  of  business  points  by  the  City  Council  Ad  Hoc  Development  Committee  and 

considered by the full City Council: 

Business  points  subject  to  the  development  agreement  and  Planning  Commission 

consideration: 

• Incorporate any reduction of mitigation fees into an approved development agreement 
with  the  property  owner  (per  State  law  all  development  agreements  must  be 
approved by the City Planning Commission). 

• Limit the reduction of fees to occur within 24 months from enactment of development 

agreement. 

Business points not under consideration by the Planning Commission but may be implemented by 
the City Council without Planning Commission review. 

• Have the City Council consider reducing all existing mitigation fees for all City development 
to the same level provided to Garden Glen for the next 24 months and limit the reduced 
mitigation to the first 200 building permits for single family houses.   

Planning Commission Agenda Report- July 2019 

Fiscal Impacts:   

•  Payback time for reduced mitigation fees of $7,806 for each house estimated at 1.7 years 
(see Exhibit A).  Garden Glen subdivision calculated mitigation fees for first 170 lots to be 
prospectively built by K’Hovnanian Homes shown on Exhibit B total $5,498,990 at existing 
rates.  Approving the requested reduction recalculates the mitigation fees to $4,171,970 for 
the first 170 homes.  Market absorption analysis that estimates the amount of houses to be 
built within a certain timeframe has not been performed by the City.  Recent building activity 
in the City indicates that it will take longer than 24 months to build and sell 170 single family 
homes in Live Oak.

Planning Commission Agenda Report- July 2019 

Background: 

For about a decade, the Garden Glen subdivision has had a recorded tentative and final map for 
its development.  At this time, the property owner (Reggie Singh) has requested a reduction in 
mitigation fees.  Currently, the City collects $32,347 in such fees for single family homes.  The City 
approved the subdivision for 189 lots, of which the property owner intends to convey 170 lots to a 
merchant builder (KHovnanian Homes).  The remaining 19 lots will be retained by Mr. Singh for 
later development.  The immediate focus for the request centers on the 170 lots that may 
potentially be built by KHovnanian Homes.   

Attached you will find a one page fiscal impact estimate that calculates the requested subsidy and 
shows the potential revenues the development will generate over time.  The requested assumes 
the collection of normal building permits fees, plan check fees, other City review fees, school 
district fees, county fees and other state agency fees due from new development.  In summary, 
the mitigation fees of $5,498,990 will be reduced to $4,171,970 for a subsidy of $1,327,020 
($7,806 per house).  Staff estimates show that the corresponding City revenues will result in a 1.7 
year payback for recouping the subsidy. 

 

For the magnitude of the development, the City Manager and Finance Director believe the 
reduction of mitigation fees of 25% or less (24.1% reduction is requested) is an acceptable 
subsidy in today’s economic conditions. The property owner met with Councilmember Thiara and 
Councilmember Tica at separate meetings regarding his request.   

 

In recent weeks, the Finance Director met with the property owner’s representatives and a 
representative from KHovnanian Homes regarding the specific business points of a potential 
development agreement.   City staff is recommending a 36 month timeframe for pulling permits for 
the subsidy and the provision that allows the developer to request an extension from the City, if 
needed.  The City will not be obligated to approve such an extension.   

 

At directed by the City Attorney, the provisions for the mitigation fee reduction must be embodied 
in an approved development agreement subject to review by the City’s Planning Commission with 
normal notification requirements for adjacent property owners.  After consideration by the 
Planning Commission, the approval of the development agreement will need City Council approval 
and enactment of a City ordinance specific to the agreement.

determined by the City Council, in which event any rule, regulation or policy imposed on

ARTICLE 6 

 

 

COOPERATION IN THE EVENT OF LEGAL CHALLENGE 

6.1 

Cooperation.  In the event of any administrative, legal, or equitable action 
 
or other proceeding instituted by any person not a party to this Agreement challenging the 
validity  of  any  provision  of  any  of  the  Entitlements,  Subsequent  Entitlements  or  this 
Agreement, the parties shall cooperate in defending such action or proceeding to dismissal, 
settlement or final judgment.  Each party may select its own legal counsel, and Developer 
shall pay City’s legal defense fees and costs, including attorneys’ fees, consistent with 
Developer’s obligations under Section 5.  In no event shall City be required to bear the fees 
or costs of Developer, including Developer’s attorneys’ fees.  If requested by Developer, 
City agrees to support any efforts made by Developer to intervene or join as a party in any 
such administrative, legal or equitable proceedings if Developer was not named as a party 
therein.  Neither Developer nor City shall settle any action or proceeding on grounds that 
include non-monetary relief or admissions of liability without written consent of the other 
party.  City agrees to not settle any action based upon monetary relief without the written 
consent of Developer, unless City is solely liable and agrees to pay such monetary relief.  
In  the  event  of  an  award  by  the  court  or  by  an  arbitrator  of  attorneys’  fees  to  a  party 
challenging this Agreement or any of the Entitlements or Subsequent Entitlements, then 
Developer shall be liable for satisfying the payment of any such award of third party’s 
attorneys’ fees only if Developer continued to contest such litigation or legal challenge to 
a final judgment or other final determination, rather than settling it when City proposed to 
settle the matter. 
 
 
Court Judgment or Order.  City and Developer shall meet and endeavor, in 
good faith to attempt to reach agreement on any amendments needed to allow development 
of  the  Property  to  proceed  in  a  reasonable  manner  taking  into  account  the  terms  and 
conditions of the court’s judgment or order.  If agreement is reached, the procedures for 
amending this Agreement as specified herein shall apply.  If agreement is not reached, 
Developer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving City sixty (60) days’ 
notice of termination.  In the event that amendment of this Agreement is not required, and 
the court’s judgment or order requires City to engage in other or further proceedings, City 
agrees to comply with the terms or the judgment or order expeditiously. 
 
 
Legal  Action.    Any  party  may  institute  legal  action  to  cure,  correct  or 
remedy any default, to specifically enforce any covenant or agreement herein, or to enjoin 
any threatened or attempted violation.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the 
contrary, the parties acknowledge that City would not have entered into this Agreement 
had it been exposed to liability for damages from Developer, and that therefore, Developer 
hereby waives any and all claims for damages against City for breach of this Agreement.  
Developer  further  acknowledges  that  as  an  instrument  which  must  be  approved  by 
ordinance, a development agreement is subject to referendum and that under law, the City 

6.2 

6.3

Council's discretion to avoid a referendum by rescinding its approval of the underlying 
ordinance  may  not  be  constrained  by  contract,  and  Developer  waives  all  claims  for 
damages against City in this regard.  Nothing in this Section is intended to nor does it limit 
Developer’s or City’s rights to equitable remedies as permitted by law.

Planning Commission Agenda Report- July 16, 2019   

Page | 1 

Background 
The applicants, Eustacio and Soledad Curiel, are requesting approval of a Variance allowing a 
previously  constructed,  non-permitted,  addition  to  a  single-family  residence.  Meaning,  the 
residential addition was not reviewed by the City prior to construction and a Building Permit 
was not issued for the construction. 
 
The project site is located at 2937 Devin Court in the Low-Density Residential Zone District (R-
1),  which  requires  a  minimum  20-foot  rear  yard  setback  or  20  percent  of  the  lot  depth, 
whichever is less (approximately 18 feet). The applicants enclosed a previously constructed 
attached covered patio in the rear yard, which according to Section 17.15.040 of the Live Oak 
Municipal Code, attached patio covers may encroach a maximum of 10 feet into the rear yard, 
as long as the patio cover is open on all sides and the side yard setbacks are met. However, 
enclosing the attached patio cover results in the residential addition having a rear yard setback 
of 11’-5”, which is not in compliance with the current 18-foot rear yard setback required by the 
Live Oak Zoning Code. 
 
The applicants, are now trying to formalize the previously constructed, non-permitted, addition 
to a single-family residence (see Attachment 01). However, because the already constructed 
addition is not in compliance with the required setbacks, Planning Commission approval of a 
Variance  is  the  only  option;  otherwise,  the  applicants  must  remove  the  non-permitted 
residential addition. Demolition would also require the approval of a Demolition Permit from the 
City Building Department. 
 
The requested Variance would be exempt from the provisions of the California Environmental 
Quality  Act  (CEQA)  under  Class  1,  Section  number  15301  (Existing  Facilities)  which  includes 
additions to an existing structure that is less than 10,000 square feet provided that the project is 
in an area where all public services and facilities are available and not environmentally sensitive. 
 
Pursuant to Section 17.35.040(E) of the Live Oak Municipal Code, a Variance may be granted 
if the Planning Commission makes the following findings: 
 
1.  There are special circumstances applicable to the property or structure(s) including location, 
size, shape, surroundings, or topography or other conditions, so that the strict application of 
this  Title  denies  the  property  owner  privileges  enjoyed  by  other  property  owners  in  the 
vicinity and within the same zone district. 

2.  Granting  the  variance  is  necessary  for  the  preservation  and  enjoyment  of  substantial 

property rights. 

3.  Granting  the  variance  does not  result  in  special  privileges  inconsistent  with  the  limitations 
upon  other  properties  in  the  vicinity  and  within  the  same  zone  district  as  the  property  is 
located. 

4.  Granting the variance does not allow a use or activity which is not otherwise authorized by 

the zone district within which the property is located. 

5.  Granting the variance will not be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, comfort or general 
welfare  of  persons  residing  or  working  in  the  vicinity  or  be  detrimental  to  property  or 
improvements in the vicinity or to the general welfare of the City. 

 
Staff  has  determined  the  special  circumstances  related  to  this  project  is  a  self-imposed 
hardship; and therefore, planning policy necessitates staff recommend denial of the requested 
Variance  and  the  Planning  Commission  adopt  the  attached  DRAFT  Denial  Resolution  (see 
Attachment 02). 
 
Planning Commission Agenda Report- July 16, 2019   

Page | 2 

Alternative Action 
 
Planning  Commission  has  discretionary  approval  of  Variances  in  the  City;  therefore,  if  the 
Planning  Commission  determines  the  project  meets  the  above  findings,  the  Planning 
Commission  could  adopt  the  attached  DRAFT  Approval  Resolution  (see  Attachment  03) 
approving  the  requested  Variance  to  formalize  the  previously  constructed,  non-permitted, 
addition to the single-family residence located at 2937 Devin Court. Staff has included draft 
findings, but the Planning Commission could add further justification. 
 
It should be noted that the applicants have provided a comment letter from the neighboring 
resident, 2924 Sebina Court, stating they have no issue with the proposed residential addition 
(see Attachment 04). 
 
It should also be noted that if the Planning Commission makes the above findings approving the 
requested Variance, this could set a precedent for the City and future projects may be subject to 
the same assessment.

WHEREAS, the City received an application from Eustacio and Soledad Curiel to 
formalize a previously constructed, non-permitted, addition to a single-family residence

WHEREAS,  on  July  16,  2019,  the  Planning  Commission  duly  held  a  public 
hearing  on  the  matter,  and  received  and  considered  evidence  both  oral  and 
documentary. 

 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  BE  IT  RESOLVED  that  the  Planning  Commission  of  the 
City of Live Oak does hereby  make the following required findings for approval  of the 
requested variance: 

 
1.  There  are  special  circumstances  applicable  to  the  property  or  structure(s) 
including  location,  size,  shape,  surroundings,  or  topography  or  other 
conditions, so that the strict application of this Title denies the property owner 
privileges  enjoyed  by  other  property  owners  in  the  vicinity  and  within  the 
same zone district. 

 
2.  Granting  the  variance  is  necessary  for  the  preservation  and  enjoyment  of 

substantial property rights. 

 
3.  Granting the variance does not result in special privileges inconsistent with 
the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and within the same zone 
district as the property is located. 

 
4.  Granting the variance does not allow a use or activity which is not otherwise 

authorized by the zone district within which the property is located.

comfort or general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity or be 
detrimental  to  property  or  improvements  in  the  vicinity  or  to  the  general 
welfare of the City. 

 
There are no special circumstances applicable to the property that would deny 
the  property  owner  privileges  enjoyed  by  other  property  owners  in  the  vicinity, 
and  granting  the  variance  would  result  in  special  privileges  inconsistent  with 
other properties in the vicinity. 
 
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Planning Commission of the City 
of  Live  Oak  does  hereby  APPROVE  a  variance  formalizing  a  previously  constructed, 

2937 Devin Court – Planning Commission Denial Variance Resolution

to keep the already constructed addition. The residential addition and use is not 
detrimental to the general welfare of the City. 
 
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Planning Commission of the City 
of  Live  Oak  does  hereby  APPROVE  a  variance  formalizing  a  previously  constructed,
