City of Live Oak 

Report to City Council 

Meeting Date:  October 2, 2019 

Title:   Resolution Amending the FY 2019-20 Budget for a New Parks Restroom at 

Pennington Ranch Park Requirements 

Location:  Citywide 

Recommendation:  Pass a Resolution amending the budget for FY 2019-20 that re-programs 
funding to build a new parks restroom at Pennington Ranch Park. 

Fiscal Impacts:  Increases the amount of money used in Fund 30 Parks AB1600 fees that was 
recently generated by impact fees received by the City for Kristen Court Phase II. 

Contact Information:  Joe Aguilar, Contract Finance Director (530) 695-2112 

Background: 

Fiscal Year 2019-20 began anticipating the receipt AB1600 Park Fees from Kristen Court Phase 
II. However,  the  budget  adopted  for  2019-20  only  authorized  the  spending  of  money  that  was
already on hand as of June 30, 2019. The amount of AB1600 Park Fees was $43,000 at June 30
and the adopted budget programed the funding to build a shade structure at the Live Oak Soccer
Park.

Most  recently,  the  City  received  $51,720  in  AB1600  Park  Fees  and  brings  the  total  money 
available  in  that  fund  to  $94,000.  Because  of  the  increase  of  money  on  hand,  City  staff 
recommends  changing  the  priority  of  spending  to  first  building  a  park  restroom  building  at 
Pennington Ranch Park. This building has an estimated cost of $80,000.  Should the City receive 
additional AB1600 Park Fees before fiscal year end, the City may stay pursue the shade structure 
at the soccer park as well.

City of Live Oak 

Report to City Council 

Meeting Date:  October 2, 2019 

Title:   Donation of Patriotic Mural at Live Oak Cemetery 

Location:  Live Oak Cemetery 

Recommendation: Discuss and provide direction regarding donating the funding to purchase a 
vinyl patriotic mural for the Live Oak Cemetery. 

Contact Information:  Aaron Palmer, City Manager (530) 695-2112 

Fiscal Impacts:   The current 2019-2020 adopted budget has $10,000 in account 10-1065-5341 
for mural projects throughout the City.  It is estimated that this project will cost $1,000.   

Description/Analysis:  The City would fund the patriotic mural project at the Cemetery for the 
estimated cost of $1,000.  The City’s Mural Ad Hoc Committee determined it would be a great 
project to partner on with the Cemetery Board and requested the City Manager to place it on a 
future agenda for the entire City Council to consider.    

Background:  The Live Oak Cemetery Board approached the City regarding the funding of one of 
the proposed City murals.  The City’s Mural Ad Hoc Committee met with staff from Yuba-Sutter 
Arts to rank possible mural projects for FY 2019-2020.  The Cemetery Board learned that a few of 
the proposed murals had a patriotic theme.  David Reed from Yuba-Sutter Arts sent the Board the 
patriotic murals to inquiry if the Board would be interested in doing any of the projects.   

The Board then approached the City and invited the Ad Hoc Committee and the City Manager to 
attend their September 11, 2019 board meeting.  Mayor Ghag and Councilmember Tica (the 
current members of the Mural Ad Hoc Committee) stated how this would be an excellent 
opportunity to partner with the Cemetery Board on such a project.
