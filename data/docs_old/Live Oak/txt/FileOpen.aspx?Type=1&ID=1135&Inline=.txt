Meeting Date: September 4, 2019 

Title:  Senate Bill 2 Grant 

Program Location:  Citywide 

Recommendation:  1) Pass a Resolution authorizing an application for and receipt of a SB2 
Planning  Grants  program  and  2)  direct  City  staff  to  submit  an  application  to  the  California 
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD).

Contact Information:  Kevin Valente, City Planner, (530) 695-2112 

Attachments: 
01-  Senate Bill 2 Grant Program City Council Resolution 
02-  Senate Bill 2 Grant Overview Memo 

Background and Discussion 
HCD  is  currently  accepting  applications  for  the  SB  2  Planning  Grants  Program.  The  SB  2 
Planning  Grants  Program  set  aside  approximately  $128  million  dollars  to  establish  a 
permanent source of funding intended to increase the affordable housing stock in California. 
The  objective  of  the  SB  2  Planning  Grants  Program  is  for  localities  to  prepare,  adopt,  and 
implement plans that streamline housing approvals and accelerate housing production. 

HCD has determined maximum award amounts for large, medium, and small localities, based 
on population. Based on population size, the City of Live Oak qualifies for a minimum grant 
award of $25,000 and a maximum grant award of $160,000. It should be noted that no local 
match is required to receive the funds. Grant applications final due date is November 30, 2019 
and any awarded grant funds must be spent by June 30, 2022.

Packet Page 28 of 498Potential Projects  
 
Based  off  of  planning  needs  for  the  City,  staff  has  prepared  the  following  list  of  potential 
projects that could qualify for the SB 2 Planning Grant Program funding: 
 
1.  AB 1600 Fee Study Update (Fee Reduction Strategy) (±$140,000) 

The  City’s  current  Land  Use  Pattern  needs  to  be  updated  to  reflect  the  City’s  future 
growth scenario, which has changed since the adoption of the current General Plan. With 
an  updated  Land  Use  Pattern,  the  City  can  prepare  accurate  circulation  and 
infrastructure maps in order to collect accurate and potentially reduces fees from future 
development. Therefore, staff recommends using SB 2 funding for the following tasks: 
 

a.  Update the City’s Land Use Pattern; 
b.  Update  the  City’s  background  General  Plan  studies  including,  utilities  and 

circulation; 

c.  Prepare an AB 1600 Fee Study 

2.  Zoning Map and General Plan Land Use Map Amendment (±$20,000) 

The City is currently beginning the steps of a Community Vision, which will serve as 
the background for updating the City’s Land Use Pattern. Once the City’s Land use 
Pattern is updated, the City will process a Zoning Map and General Plan Land Use 
Map  Amendment  that  will  re-designate  land  for  consistency  with  the  Community 
Vision  and  the  Housing  Element  Update,  and  provide  compliance  with  the  next 
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) cycle to accelerate housing.

The  legislation  directs  that  HCD  utilize  50  percent  of  the  first  year’s  revenue  to  establish  a 
program that provides financial and technical assistance to local governments to update their 
planning  documents  and  land  use  ordinances.  The  objective  of  the  SB  2  Planning  Grants 
Program  is  for  localities  to  prepare,  adopt,  and  implement  plans  that  streamline  housing 
approvals and accelerate housing production.  
 
Funding Available 
 
HCD has determined maximum award amounts for large, medium, and small localities, based 
on  population  estimates  from  the  Department  of  Finance  (DOF).  The  table  below  shows  the

Exhibit 1 

 

Priority Policy Areas Descriptions 

 

Applicants  proposing  activities  in  at  least  one  of  the  Priority  Policy  Areas  (PPAs)  below  are 
automatically deemed to demonstrate a nexus to accelerating housing production without any 
further demonstration. The following is a complete description of the PPAs: 
 

•  Rezone to Permit By-right: Rezoning for significant additional housing capacity without 
or  lesser  discretionary  review  or  establishing  zoning  to  permit  residential  development 
by-right,  particularly  multifamily,  without  discretionary  action  pursuant  to  Government 
Code Section 65583.2(h) and (i). 
 

•  Objective  Design  and  Development  Standards:  Developing  objective  design 
standards  or  pre-approved  site  and  architectural  plans  that  facilitate  non-discretionary 
permitting. 
 

•  Specific Plans or Form based Codes Coupled with CEQA Streamlining: Designating 
and rezoning for additional housing capacity or preparing specific plans or form codes 
that  include  zoning  and  development  standards  and  plan-level  environmental  analysis 
that can be used to streamline future housing projects and facilitate affordability. 
 

•  Accessory  Dwelling  Units  or  Other  Innovative  Building  Strategies: Encouraging 
ADUs  and  other  innovative  building  types  through  actions  above  state  law  such  as, 
outreach,  fee  waivers,  pre-approved  plans,  website  zoning  clearance  assistance,  and 
other homeowner tools or finance tools. Also, establishing other approaches to intensify 
existing  lower  density  residential  areas  and  “missing  model”  typologies  to  encourage 
significantly  more  residential  development  (e.g.,  duplexes,  triplexes)  in  lower  density 
residential areas. 
 

•  Expedited  Processing:  Speeding  up  approvals  and  permit  processing,  including 
instituting  programs  that  streamline  or  consolidate  the  review  process  or  create  a 
separate process for expedited review of housing projects.

In October of 2017, City Council approved Resolution 52-2017 authorizing the mayor to sign the 
TIGER grant agreement.  Historically, Council has authorized the City Manager to sign all 
agreements.  This resolution will return authorization for signature to the City Manager or his 
designee if he is unavailable for signature, and will also authorize the signature of any 
amendments to the original agreement which was omitted in the original resolution.

Packet Page 37 of 498The Electric Maintenance Agreement is nearly identical to our previous Electric Maintenance 
Agreements on the highway, the version before you tonight has the addition of the new stoplight.  
This agreement will supersede any current agreements on file.  The Landscape Maintenance 
Agreement is similar to the 5 current Landscape Maintenance Agreements we have on file, this 
new agreement will combine all 5 agreements into one and update some outdated language 
related to maintenance, the use of pesticides and herbicides, maintenance worker safety, and 
other minor details.  The on-going discussions are related to the Low Impact Drainage areas, 
these are a new requirement for storm drain water runoff and Caltrans and City staff are working 
through the best way to handle these areas. 

The Water and Sewer Utility Agreements are completely new.  These two agreements are 
allowing Caltrans to include the City water and sewer utility relocation and repair into their 
construction contract, and provide a method for billing the City for that construction work.  By 
allowing Caltrans to bid and construct the City utility work into their contract, we anticipate a 
savings in construction costs, and a savings in construction management costs.  This will also 
allow Caltrans better management of the overall project, better coordinate contractors, and allow 
them to better manage the timelines allowing us to comply with our TIGER Grant funding 
requirements.

completed by July 25, 2020 (the “Date of Completion”), unless otherwise agreed in writing 
by City. 

B.  Borrower agrees that any Development costs, unless otherwise specified, exceeding the 
$4,500,000 in HOME Program funds provided by City pursuant to this Agreement shall be 
the responsibility of Borrower. Borrower further agrees to pay maintenance and operating 
costs for the Development. In no event shall any amount due under the Note become subject 
to any rights, offset, deduction or counterclaim on the part of Borrower. 

C.  Changes in the Scope of Services, attached hereto as Exhibit “E”, as outlined herein shall 
be in accordance with the HOME Program regulations, made by written amendment to this 
Agreement and approved by both Parties. Any such changes shall comply with HOME 
Program funding regulations. 

D.  HOME Program funds shall be disbursed at time of and following construction loan closing 
upon  submission  to  City  a  written request  for funding,  provided  that the  Conditions  to

II.  General Conditions.  Borrower agrees to abide by all conditions fully set forth below. 

A.  Borrower has agreed that twenty-four (24) units shall be Assisted Units as defined in the 
Regulatory Agreement. These units shall serve low-income families and have HOME rents. 
The location of the units may float throughout the Development. 

B.  Borrower has requested the financial support of City that is provided for in this Agreement 
in order to enable Borrower to provide affordable housing services.  City  shall  have  no 
relationship  whatsoever  with  the  services  provided,  except  the  provision  of  financial 
support, monitoring, and the receipt of such reports as are provided for herein. Borrower 
represents that such reports shall be true and correct to the best of its knowledge. To the 
extent, if at all, that any relationship to such services on the part of City may be claimed or 
found to exist, Borrower shall be an independent contractor only. 

C.  Borrower shall obtain any and all federal, state, and local permits and licenses required to 
complete  the  Development  as  described  in  this  Agreement.  Borrower  further  agrees  to

tenants,  as  defined  in  the  HOME  Regulations  (24  CFR  92).  Any  lessee,  sub-lessee,  or 
assignee of a HOME Assisted Unit shall meet HOME Program requirements and serve 
eligible low-income residents. 

G.  If  the  affordable  housing  units,  or  any  portion  thereof,  are  subleased  without  the  prior 
written approval of City or if, through foreclosure, sale, or other circumstances Borrower 
loses legal possession of the Development, Borrower shall, upon the request of City, repay 
to City, the remaining balance of the Loan that Borrower received from City hereunder. 
The Deed of Trust shall be subordinated to the construction and permanent lender deed of 
trust securing the permanent loan, and City hereby agrees to subordinate the Deed of Trust

lenders which expressly includes any affiliate of a general partner of Borrower, state tax 
credit allocating agencies (if any), and the limited partners as the permanent financiers of 
the Development. Any permanent loan by Borrower from an affiliate of a general partner 
shall be considered third party debt and payable in accordance with Section IV.D (b) (3) of 
this  Agreement.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  City  hereby  consents  to  Borrower 
obtaining a permanent mortgage loan made or insured by or through USDA. 

I.  Borrower  shall  not  assign  or  delegate  any  of  its  rights,  interests  or  duties  under  this 
Agreement  without  the  prior  written  consent  of  City,  which  consent  shall  not  be 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 45 of 498unreasonably  withheld.  Any  such  assignment  of  delegation  made  without  the  required 
consent shall be voidable by City, and may, at the option of City, result in the termination 
and repayment of all financial support provided herein. 

J.  Borrower shall carry or provide insurance as set forth in the Regulatory Agreement. 

K.  Borrower  shall  allow  duly  authorized  representatives  of  City  to  conduct  such  periodic 
reviews, audits and on-site monitoring of the Development as City deems to be appropriate 
in order to determine: 

1.  Whether the objectives of the Development are being achieved;

4.  Whether financial operations of the Development are being conducted properly; 
5.  Whether the periodic reports to City contain accurate and reliable information; and

visits  and  shall  occur  during  normal  operating  hours.  The  representatives  of  City  may 
request, and, if such a request is made, shall be granted, access to all of the records of 
Borrower which relate to the Development. The representatives of City may, from time to 
time, interview recipients of the housing services of the Development who volunteer to be 
interviewed. 

L.  At  any  time  during  normal  business  hours,  Borrower  records  with  respect  to  the 
Development  shall  be  made  available  for  audit,  examination  and  review  by  City,  the 
Attorney  General’s  Office,  contracted  independent  auditors,  HUD,  the  Comptroller 
General of the United States, or any combination thereof. 

M. Borrower shall protect, defend, indemnify, and save and hold harmless City, its officers, 
employees and agents from and against any and all liability, damages, demands, claims, 
suits,  liens, and  judgments  of  whatever  nature including,  but  not  limited  to,  claims  for 
contribution or indemnification for injuries to or death of any person or persons, caused 
by,  in  connection  with,  or  arising  out  of  any  activities  undertaken  pursuant  to  this 
Agreement  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  construction  or  operation  of  the  Project. 
Borrower’s obligation to protect, defend, indemnify, and save and hold harmless as set 
forth in this Section II.M. shall include any and all reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by 
City, its officers, employees and agents in the defense of handling of said suits, demands, 
judgments, liens and claims and all reasonable attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses

Borrower agrees to notify City promptly of any legal action which is filed by or against it. 

O.  This  Agreement  shall  commence  upon  its  approval  and  signature  by  the  Parties.  The 
Period  of  Affordability  shall  be  governed according to the terms and conditions set forth 
in Section III. K. below. 

P.  Borrower agrees that no officer or employee of Borrower may seek or accept any gifts, 
service,  favor,  employment,  engagement,  emolument  or  economic  opportunity  which 
would tend improperly to influence a reasonable person in that position to depart from the 
faithful and impartial discharge of the duties of that position. 

Q.  Borrower agrees that no officer or employee of Borrower may use his or her position to 
secure or grant any unwarranted privilege, preference, exemption or advantage for himself 
or herself, any member of his or her household, any business entity in which he or she has 
a financial interest or any other person. 

R.  Borrower agrees that no officer or employee of Borrower may suppress any report or other 
document because it might tend to affect unfavorably his or her private financial interests. 

S.  Borrower shall keep and maintain in effect at all times any and all licenses, permits, notices 
and certifications which may be required by any City ordinance or state or federal statute. 

T.  Borrower shall be bound by all City and county ordinances and state and federal statutes, 
conditions, regulations and assurances which are applicable to the entire HOME Program 
or are required by HUD, City, or any combination thereof. 

U.  At the discretion of City, any material breach of this Section II may, after thirty (30) day

cure such material breach, result in forfeiture of all HOME Program funds received by 
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, or any part thereof. 

V.  An audited cost certification shall be submitted by Borrower to City within sixty (60) days 

after completion of the Development. 

W. The obligations of Borrower shall be nonrecourse as described in the Note. 

X.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  herein,  any  cure  of  any  default  or  Event  of 
Default made or tendered by a limited partner of Borrower shall be deemed to be a cure by 
Borrower and shall be accepted or rejected on the same basis as if made or tendered by 
Borrower.  Copies  of  all  notices  which  are  sent  to  Borrower  under  the  terms  of  this 
Agreement shall also be sent to Borrower’s limited partner as defined in Section VII. C.

thereof for cause, pursuant to the terms of Borrower’s Amended and Restated Agreement 
of  Limited  Partnership  dated  August  1,  2019,  as  amended  from  time  to  time  (the 
“Partnership Agreement”). Moreover, if any limited partner of Borrower exercises its  right 
to remove a general partner thereof, City shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to the 
substitute  general  partner.  The  respective  interests  of  Borrower’s  limited  partners  shall 
be transferrable without the consent of City; provided that, replacement of a general partner 
with the Borrower’s limited partner or administrative limited partner, or an affiliate  thereof, 
shall  require  the  consent  of  the  City.  Consent  of  City  shall  be  required  for  any 
amendment to the Partnership Agreement in order to effectuate a transfer authorized by 
this Section II.Y. In cases where consent of City is not required, City will be notified of the 
action so as to comment as desired.

adverse change as determined by City in its reasonable judgment shall have occurred in the

Packet Page 51 of 498c.  The balance of Operating Income, as defined in Section III. (j) of the Regulatory 
Agreement, remaining after the payments described in Section IV. D (b). above 
shall  be  deemed  Residual  Receipts.  The  amount  paid  to  City  towards  unpaid 
accrued interest  and then  to  principal  on the  HOME  loan  shall  be calculated as 
follows:  City  Loan  unpaid  principal  balance  divided  by  the  combined  unpaid 
principal balances of all subordinate debt. The calculated proportion applied to 50% 
of Residual Receipts. 

E.  Changes in work to be performed (“Change Orders”). 

a.  No  Change  Orders  shall  be  allowed  unless  specifically  stated  in  writing  by  the 
Borrower and City. Except for the purpose of being protected against an emergency 
endangering life or property, Borrower shall make no changes in the proposed work 
which would include any extra or additional work, supply additional labor, services 
or  materials  beyond  what  is  actually  required  for  the  execution  of  the  contract 
unless  pursuant  to  a  written  order  from  the  Borrower  and  City  authorizing  the 
change.  No  claim  for  an  adjustment  of  contract  price  will  be  valid  unless  so 
approved in writing. 

b.  Any  Change  Order  shall  include  in  its  final  form  a  detailed  description  of  the 
proposed change in the work, a definitive statement as to the resulting change in 
the  contract  price  and/or  time  of  completion  and  the  statement  that  all  work 
involved in the changes are allowable under the HOME Investment Partnerships 
Program guidelines, and in accordance with the contract requirements except as 
modified by the Change Order. 

c.  All Change Order requests shall be submitted to City in writing and City shall have 
ten (10) business days from receipt of the submission to approve or disapprove said 
Change Order requests. If not approved in writing within ten (10) business days, 
the  City  shall  be  notified  in  writing  that  said  Change  Order  shall  be  deemed 
approved at the end of three (3) business days from the date the Notice is received 
by the City. 

V.  Modification or Revocation of Agreement. 

A.  City  shall  have  the  right  to  amend  or  otherwise  revise  this  Agreement,  should  such 
modification  be  required  by  HUD  or  any  applicable  Federal  statutes  or regulations  and 
Borrower  shall  approve  any  such  regulated  changes  provided  such  changes  do  not 
materially  change  the  economic  terms  described  herein  or  expand  Borrower’s  liability 
hereunder. 

B.  In the event that any of the HOME Program funds for any reason are terminated or withheld 
from City or otherwise not forthcoming, City shall have the right to revoke this Agreement 
to the extent of any such shortfall. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 52 of 498C.  This Agreement shall only be modified by a written amendment signed by the Parties, or 

as otherwise set forth in the terms of the Agreement. 

D.  City  acknowledges  that  the  Development  is  being  developed  and  operated  so  that  one 
hundred percent (100%) of the units (other than unit occupied by resident managers) will 
qualify for low income housing tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code 
of  1986,  as  amended  (the  “Code”)  (“LIHTCs”).  City  agrees  that  nothing  in  the  Loan 
Documents shall require Borrower to violate the requirements of Section 42 of the Code or 
the  Treasury  Regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  or  to  operate  the  Development  in  a 
manner that would prevent one hundred percent (100%) of the units (other than the unit 
occupied  by  resident  managers)  from  qualifying  for  LIHTCs.  Without  limiting  the 
generality of the foregoing, City acknowledges that the household size appropriate for each 
unit shall be determined according to the LIHTC rules and regulations. 

VI.  Defaults and Remedies. 

A.  An  Event  of  Default  shall  arise  hereunder  upon:  (i)  Borrower’s  material  breach  of  any 
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation under this Agreement, the Note, the Deed 
of Trust or the Regulatory Agreement which is not cured within thirty (30) days after notice 
thereof given by City to Borrower and Borrower’s limited partners, or in the case of a 
default for which a cure is not possible within thirty (30) days, for which a cure is not 
commenced within thirty (30) days and diligently prosecuted to completion; or (ii) an event 
of default on the part of Borrower shall have arisen under any other document evidencing 
or securing financing for the Development or imposing occupancy, rent or other restrictions 
on  the  Development,  and  shall  have  remained  uncured  beyond  the  expiration  of  all 
applicable cure periods. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, City 
hereby agrees that any cure of any default made or tendered by one or more of Borrower’s 
partners shall be deemed to be a cure by Borrower and shall be accepted or rejected on the 
same basis as if made or tendered by Borrower. 

B.  Upon occurrence of an Event of Default, City may pursue any remedy allowed at law or in 
equity or under any of this Agreement, the Regulatory Agreement, the Note and the Deed 
of  Trust,  including  but  not  limited  to,  accelerating  payment  under  the  Note,  pursuing

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 53 of 498foreclosure under the Deed of Trust, or applying to any state or federal court for an order 
of specific performance of this Agreement and the Regulatory Agreement. 

C.  The exercise by City of one or more remedy shall not preclude the exercise by it, at the 
same or different time, of any other remedy for the same or any other default hereunder. 
No failure or delay by City in asserting any of its rights and remedies as to any default shall 
operate as a waiver of such default or of any such rights or remedies, nor deprive City its 
rights to institute and maintain any action or proceeding which it may deem necessary to 
protect, assert or enforce any such rights or remedies in the same or any subsequent default. 

VII.  Miscellaneous. 

A.  Equal  Opportunity.  During  the  construction  of  the  Development  there  shall  be  no 
discrimination  on  the  basis  of  race,  color,  creed,  religion,  age,  sex,  sexual  orientation, 
marital status, national origin, ancestry, or disability in the hiring, firing, promoting, or 
demoting of any person engaged in the construction work. 

B.  Borrower  shall  not  discriminate  against  any  prospective  tenant  in  the  use,  enjoyment, 
occupancy, conveyance, lease, sublease, or rental of any part of the Development on the 
basis of race, religion, sex, age, disability, marital status, nor any other arbitrary factor in 
violation  of  any  state,  federal  or  local  law  governing  discrimination  in  rental  housing. 
Housing which is intended to benefit, and is therefore limited to senior citizens, is permitted 
only with the prior approval of the selection criteria by City. 

C.  Any notice required or authorized under this Agreement shall be effective if, and only if, 
in writing and if, and only if, mailed, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, to the

August, 2019 (the “Effective Date”), by and between Live Oak Pacific Associates II, a California

Recitals 

A.  Borrower is the owner of real property located in the City of Live Oak, California and more 

fully described in Exhibit A (the “Property”). 

B.  Borrower has proposed to develop the Property by constructing thereon a 24-unit rental 
housing  development  of  which  24  units  will  be  Assisted  Units  (defined  below)  to  be 
occupied by Low Income Households (the “Development”). 

C.  The Development will be financed in whole or in part and regulated by a permanent loan 
from City in a principal amount of not to exceed Four Million Five Hundred Thousand 
Dollars and No Cents ($4,500,000.00) (the “HOME Loan”) from the Home Investment 
Partnerships  Program  (the  “HOME  Program”).  The  HOME  Loan  will  be  provided  to 
Borrower by City in accordance with 42 USC 12741 et seq., 24 CFR Part 92, California 
Health and Safety Section 50896 and Title 25, California Code of Regulations, Sections 
8200  through  8220,  (together,  the  “HOME  Regulations”).  In  consideration  of  City’s 
commitment to make the HOME Loan provided that HOME Program funds are available 
to City, City and the California Department of Housing and Community Development (the

Agreement with respect to the Development. Borrower shall execute a promissory note 
evidencing its obligation to repay the HOME Loan (the “Note”) and a deed of trust in favor 
of City to be recorded against Borrower’s interest in the Property securing repayment of 
the Note (the “Deed of Trust”). Borrower agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions 
of the Note and Deed of Trust. The Note, the Deed of Trust, the Standard Agreement, the 
City  Loan  Agreement,  the  Subordination  Agreement  dated  September        ,  2019  (the 
“Subordination Agreement”), and this Agreement are collectively referred to herein as  the 
“HOME Loan Documents”. 

F.  As further consideration for the HOME Loan and in furtherance of the purposes of the 
HOME Program, Borrower has agreed to enter into this Agreement. The purpose of this 
Agreement  is  to  regulate  and  restrict  occupancy,  rents,  operations,  ownership  and 
management  of  the  Development  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  HOME 
Program.

1.  Recitals.  The foregoing recitals are a part of this Agreement. 

2.  Property. The Development will be located on the Property.

Program,  including  the  statutes,  the  HOME  Regulations  and  such  policies  and 
procedures  of  City,  the  Department  and  HUD  pertaining  thereto.  Borrower 
acknowledges  that  it  is  familiar  with  such  applicable  provisions  and  has  been 
professionally advised to the extent necessary for the purpose of enabling Borrower 
to fully comply with such provisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 63 of 498b.  The financial assistance provided under the HOME Program is governed by 24 
CFR Part 92. With respect to the assistance, Borrower agrees to comply with all 
requirements  and  obligations  as  described  in  24  CFR  Part  92,  as  well  as  all 
provisions governing the use of HOME funds. Borrower further agrees to comply 
with the directives of City as necessary to ensure compliance with the obligations 
of City as set forth in its agreements with HUD and/or the Department regarding 
the use of HOME funds. 

c.  City acknowledges that the Development is being developed and operated so that 
one hundred percent (100%) of the units (other than the unit occupied by resident 
managers) will qualify for low income housing tax credits under Section 42 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (“LIHTCs”). City agrees 
that nothing in the HOME Loan Documents shall require Borrower to violate the 
requirements of Section 42 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated 
thereunder,  or  to  operate  the  Development  in  a  manner  that  would  prevent  one 
hundred  percent  (100%)  of  the  units  (other  than  units  occupied  by  resident 
managers) from qualifying for LIHTCs. 

5.  Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall commence upon its recordation in 
the Official Records of Sutter County and remain in full force and effect and apply to the 
Development through and including the date which is fifty-five (55) years from the date of 
“Project Completion” as specified at 24 CFR 92.2, regardless of any prepayment of the 
HOME  Loan  or  sale,  assignment,  transfer  or  conveyance  of  the  Development,  unless 
terminated  earlier  by  City  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  this  Agreement  or  extended  by  the 
mutual  consent  of  the  Parties.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  this  Agreement  shall 
terminate  upon  the  involuntary  non-compliance  with  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement 
caused by fire, seizure, change in federal law or action of a federal agency after the date 
hereof which prevents City from enforcing the provisions hereof, or condemnation or a 
similar event; provided, however, that the preceding provisions of this sentence shall cease 
to apply and the restrictions contained herein shall be reinstated if, at any time subsequent 
to  the  termination  of  such  provisions,  Borrower  or  any  related  person  to  it  (within  the 
meaning of Section 1.103-10(e) of the Treasury Regulations) obtains an ownership interest 
in the Developer for federal income tax purposes. 

6.  Assisted  Unit  Schedule.  Upon  occupancy  following  the  completion  of  construction, 
Borrower  shall  rent  Assisted  Unit  in  accordance  with  this  Agreement,  the  Schedule  of 
Assisted Units set forth in Exhibits B and E, attached hereto and incorporated herein. 

7.  Tenant Selection Standards. Borrower shall rent Assisted Units in the Development only 
to Eligible Households in accordance with the Management Plan approved by and on file 
with City pursuant to this section. Such Management Plan  may be periodically altered 
and such alteration must be submitted to and approved by City prior to use. At all times, a 
minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the Assisted Units must 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 64 of 498be rented to Very Low Income Households and, at initial occupancy, no less than ninety 
percent (90%) of the Assisted Units shall be occupied by households whose incomes are at 
sixty percent (60%) and below of Area Median Income, unless stricter limitations are set 
forth in Exhibits B and E, attached hereto and incorporated herein. The Management Plan 
shall  include  among  other  things:  (1)  detailed  actions  to  be  taken  by  Borrower  to 
affirmatively market vacant units in a manner which ensures equal access to all persons in 
any  category  protected  by  federal,  state  or  local  laws  governing  discrimination,  and 
regardless  of  any  arbitrary  factor;  (2)  specific  reasonable  criteria  for  determination  of 
tenant eligibility, including household size in accordance with the minimum occupancy 
standard specified in the HOME Regulations; (3) a requirement that eligible tenants be 
selected based on order of applications, lottery, or other reasonable method approved by 
City; (4) specific procedures through which tenant applicants deemed to be ineligible shall 
be notified of the reason for their ineligibility and may appeal this determination; (5) a 
requirement for maintenance of a waiting list of eligible applicants; (6) specific procedures 
for obtaining information regarding prospective tenants’ incomes as necessary to certify 
that such income does not exceed the lower or very low income limit; and (7) affirmative 
fair housing marketing procedures as specified in the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing 
Plan Compliance Regulations of HUD, 24 CFR Part 200.620(a)-(c), or similar affirmative 
fair housing marketing plan as approved by City. 

8.  Period of Affordability.  “Period of Affordability” means a period of the years as listed 
below beginning from the date of Project Completion as defined by 24 CFR 92.2 wherein 
the Development must meet the affordability requirements contained herein. The period of 
years shall consist of the Federal period of affordability (the “Federal Period”) and the State 
period of affordability (the “State Period”) which shall run concurrently from the date of 
Project Completion. The Federal Period is a term of twenty (20) years, and the State Period 
is  a  term  of  fifty-five  (55)  years.  The  Federal  Period  is  established  by  HOME  Federal 
Regulations (the “Final Rule”), 24 CFR 92.254(e), and the State Period is established by 
HOME Investment Partnership Program Regulations section 8208 in effect as of March 
26, 1996. 

9.  Marketing Plan. 

a.  Borrower shall prepare and implement a Marketing Plan, subject to prior approval 
by  City,  which  approval  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld  or  delayed,  which 
specifies how Borrower intends to market the Development to prospective tenants 
in the Development’s market area. The Marketing Plan shall specifically address 
how Borrower intends to market the Development to underserved populations in 
Development market area and the frequency of marketing efforts. City agrees that 
Borrower may utilize the HUD 935.2 Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan for 
these purposes. 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 65 of 498b.  Borrower agrees to evaluate the effectiveness of the Marketing Plan in reaching 
underserved populations on an annual basis and to revise it as necessary to better 
reach underserved populations that are not being reached. The revised Marketing 
Plan  shall  be  submitted  to  City  for  approval,  which  approval  shall  not  be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed, prior to implementation. 

10. Nondiscrimination.  Borrower  shall  not  discriminate  against  any  tenant  or  prospective 
tenant on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, familial 
status, nor any other arbitrary factor in violation of any state, federal or local law governing 
discrimination in rental housing. 

11. Rental Agreement and Occupancy Procedures (the “Lease”). 

a.  Each Eligible Household selected to occupy a unit in the Development shall enter 
into  a  written  rental  agreement  with  Borrower  on  a  form  approved  by  City, 
containing such provisions as are required by the HOME Regulations (the “Lease”). 
The Lease shall be for a term of not less than one (1) year unless a shorter term is 
mutually agreed upon between Borrower and tenant. 

b.  Each Lease shall not contain any of the following provisions: 

1)  Agreement by the tenant to be sued, to admit guilt, or to a judgment in favor 
of Borrower or Borrower’s agent in a lawsuit brought in connection with 
the Lease; 

2)  Agreement  by  the  tenant  that  Borrower  may  take,  hold,  or  sell  personal 
property of household members without notice to the tenant and a court 
decision on the rights of the parties. This prohibition, however, does not 
apply  to  an  agreement  by  the  tenant  concerning  disposition  of  personal 
property remaining in the housing unit after the tenant has moved out of the 
unit. Borrower may dispose of this personal property in accordance with 
State law; 

3)  Agreement by the tenant not to hold Borrower or Borrower’s agents legally 
responsible for any action or failure to act, whether intentional or negligent; 

4)  Agreement of the tenant that Borrower or Borrower’s Agent may institute a 

lawsuit without notice to the tenant; 

5)  Agreement by the tenant that Borrower or Borrower’s agent may evict the 
tenant or household members without instituting a civil court proceeding in 
which the tenant has the opportunity to present a defense, or before a court 
decision on the rights of the parties; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 66 of 4986)  Agreement by the tenant to waive any right to a trial by jury; 

7)  Agreement by the tenant to waive tenant’s right to appeal, or to otherwise 

challenge in court, a court decision in connection with the Lease; and 

8)  Agreement by the tenant to pay attorneys’ fees or other legal costs even if 
the tenant wins in a court proceeding by the owner against the tenant. The 
tenant, however, may be obligated to pay costs if the tenant loses. 

c.  Borrower  shall  establish reasonable rules  of  conduct and  occupancy.  Such  rules 
shall be consistent with state law and the HOME Regulations. Said rules shall be in 
writing and shall be given to each tenant upon occupancy. Any change shall become 
effective no fewer than thirty (30) days after giving written notice thereof to each 
household. 

d.  Borrower shall not terminate the tenancy or refuse to renew the Lease of a tenant 
of rental housing assisted with HOME funds except for serious or repeated violation 
of the terms and conditions of the Lease; for violation of tenancy period; or for 
other  good  cause.  Any  termination  or  refusal  to  renew  a  Lease  shall  be  by  the 
owner’s service upon the tenant of a written notice in compliance with State law 
and specifying the grounds for the action. 

e.  Borrower shall maintain the premises in compliance with all applicable housing 

quality standards and local code requirements.  

12. Rents. 

a.  For  all  Assisted  Units,  Rents  shall  not  exceed  High  HOME  Rents  less  a  utility 
allowance. For Assisted Units that are set-aside for Very Low Income Households, 
HOME rents shall not exceed Low HOME Rents less a utility allowance. 

b.  A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of all Assisted Units shall be occupied by 
Very Low Income Households at Rents that are no greater than the Low HOME 
Rents less a utility allowance, unless stricter limitations are set forth in Exhibits B 
and E, attached hereto and incorporated herein. 

c.  Any  household  certified  as  an  Eligible  Household  upon  occupancy  but  whose 
income  increases  above  the  eligibility  level  must  pay  as  Rent  the  lesser  of  the 
amount payable by the tenant under State or local law or thirty percent (30%) of 
the household’s adjusted monthly income; except that, Assisted Units subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 67 of 498low-income tax credit rules under Section 42 of the Code shall be governed by such 
rules. 

d.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  or  any  other  requirements  and/or  restriction 
contained herein, the Rent charged on the Assisted Units shall not exceed the rent 
applicable  to  an  individual  or  family  qualifying  under  the  percentage  of  Area 
Median  Income  as  follows:  Twelve  (12)  Assisted  Units  shall  be  rented  at  forty 
percent (40%) of Area Median Income and Twelve (12) Assisted Units shall be 
rented at fifty percent (50%) of Area Median Income. See Exhibit E for specifics. 

13. Security Deposits. 

a.  Security deposits shall be required of tenants only in accordance with State law and 

this Agreement. 

b.  Any  security  deposits  collected  by  Borrower  or  Borrower’s  agent  shall  be  kept 
separate and apart from all other funds of the Development in a trust account with 
a depository insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (F.D.I.C.), or 
other  comparable  federal  deposit  insurance  program,  and  shall  be  held  and 
disbursed in accordance with State law. The balance of such account shall at all 
times  equal  or  exceed  the  aggregate  of  all  outstanding  obligations  under  said 
account, plus accrued interest thereon. 

14. Certification of Tenant Income and Household Size. 

a.  The income and household size of all households occupying Assisted Units shall 
be certified by Borrower prior to occupancy and re-certified annually thereafter in 
a manner approved by City and specified in the Development’s Management Plan. 

b.  If  the  income  of  a  tenant  upon  re-certification  exceeds  the  upper  limit  for  Low 
Income  Households,  and  there  are  no  other requirements  statutorily  imposed  by 
another federal or State funding source or tax credit program, including Section 42 
of the code, that tenant shall not have his or her Lease terminated as a result thereof, 
but shall be charged Rents as provided in Section 12 (c). 

c.  Subject  to  Section  14(b),  where  a  household  occupying  a  unit  designated  for 
occupancy by a Very Low Income Household no longer so qualifies at the time of 
re-certification,  but  qualifies  as  an  otherwise  Eligible  Household,  the  Rent 
appropriated for that income level shall be charged. 

d.  City  acknowledges  that  the  household  size  appropriate  for  each  unit  shall  be 

determined according to the LIHTC rules and regulations. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 68 of 49815. Assisted Unit Substitutions.

c.  If,  upon  re-certification,  the  income  of  a  household  occupying an  Assisted  Unit 
reserved for occupancy by Low Income Households exceeds the upper limit for 
Low  Income,  Borrower  may  designate  such  household’s  unit  as  a  non-Assisted 
Unit, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied: 

1)  Not  later  than  the  date  Borrower  designates  the  unit  as  non-Assisted, 
Borrower  also  makes  available  a  comparable  vacant  unit  previously 
designated  as  non-Assisted  to  be  designated  as  an  Assisted  Unit,  or 
designates  a  previously  non-Assisted  Unit  occupied  by  a  Low  Income 
Household as an Assisted Unit, or agrees to occupy the next available unit 
with a Low Income Household; and 

2)  The Rent charged for the newly designated Assisted Unit will not exceed 

the High HOME Rent as shown in Exhibit E attached hereto. 

d.  Subject to the limitations imposed by Exhibit E, where a household occupying an 
Assisted Unit reserved for occupancy by Very Low Income Households no longer 
qualifies as Very Low Income at the time of re-certification, but qualifies as a Low 
Income Household, the following shall apply: 

1)  Borrower  shall  designate  the  unit  as  an  Assisted  Unit  for  Low  Income 

Households; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 69 of 4982)  Borrower may increase the household’s Rent up to the High HOME Rent 

as shown in Exhibit E attached hereto; 

3)  Borrower  shall  designate  the  next  available  comparable  Assisted  Unit 
reserved for Lower Income  Households as an Assisted Unit reserved for 
Very Low Income Households as shown in Exhibit E attached hereto; and 

4)  The Rent charged for the newly designated Assisted Unit reserved for Very 
Low Income Households shall not exceed the Low HOME Rent as shown 
in Exhibit E attached hereto. 

16. Rental Agreement and Grievance Procedures. 

The  rental  agreement  and  grievance  procedures  shall  be  in  accordance  with  California 
Code of Regulations, Title 25, Division 1, Chapter 7, Subchapter 19, Section 8307. 

a.  One-year Term. All rental or occupancy agreements for HOME-assisted units shall 
be for a term of not less than one (1) year unless by mutual agreement between the 
tenant and Borrower. 

b.  City Approval. All rental or occupancy agreements shall be on a form approved by 

City and shall include the following: 

1)  Provisions requiring good cause for termination of tenancy; 

2)  A provision requiring that the facts constituting the grounds for any eviction 

be set forth in the notice provided to the tenant pursuant to state law; 

3)  A  notice  of  grievance  procedures  for  hearing  complaints  of  tenants  and 

appeal of management action; and 

4)  A requirement that the tenant actually recertify household income and size. 

17. Foreclosure after Development Completion. Borrower promises, covenants, warrants and 
represents that it shall complete the Development. Whether or not the Development is in 
fact completed shall be solely determined by the City. Should the Development in fact have 
been  completed,  then  the  Period  of  Affordability  shall  terminate  upon  foreclosure  or 
transfer  in  lieu  of  foreclosure,  except  that  the  affordability restrictions shall  be  revived 
according to the original terms if, (a) during the original Period of Affordability, the owner 
of record before the foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, or any entity that includes 
the former owner or those with whom the former owner has or had family business ties, 
obtains an ownership interest in the Development or the Property, or if (b) the foreclosing 
entity or transferee in lieu of foreclosure assumes in writing and agrees to be bound by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 70 of 498terms of the HOME Standard Agreement and the HOME Loan Documents, as that term is 
defined in the HOME Standard Agreement. 

18. Maintenance and Management. 

a.  Borrower is specifically responsible for all maintenance, repair and management 
functions for the Development, including without limitation, selection of tenants, 
re-certification of household income and size, evictions, collection of rents, routine 
and extraordinary repairs and replacement of capital items. Borrower shall maintain 
all units and common areas in a safe and sanitary manner in accordance with local 
health, building, and housing codes, HUD housing quality standards pursuant to 24 
CFR Section 882.109, and the Management Plan described above. 

b.  Borrower may, with the prior written approval of City, contract with a management 
agent  for  the  performance  of  the  services  or  duties  required  in  Section  18(a). 
However,  such  an  arrangement  does  not  relieve  Borrower  of  responsibility  for 
proper  performance  of  these  duties.  Such  contract  shall  contain  a  provision 
allowing Borrower to terminate the contract without penalty upon no more than 
thirty  day’s  (30)  notice.  Upon  a  determination  by  City,  and  notice  to  Borrower 
thereof,  that  the  management  agent  has  failed  to  operate  the  Development  in 
accordance with this Agreement, Borrower shall exercise such right of termination 
forthwith and shall make immediate arrangements, which shall be subject to City 
approval, for continuing performance of the requirements of this Agreement. 

c.  Borrower may operate the Development itself only with prior written approval of 
City.  Subject  to  the  terms  of  the  Subordination  Agreement  and  upon  a 
determination by City and notice to Borrower thereof, that Borrower has failed to 
operate  the  Development  in  accordance  with  this  Agreement,  City  may  require 
Borrower to contract with management agent to operate the Development, or to 
make such other arrangements as City deems necessary to ensure performance of 
the requirements of this Agreement. 

19. Hazard and Liability Insurance. 

a.  Borrower shall at all times keep the Development insured against loss by fire, flood 
(as  required  pursuant  to  24  CFR  92.358),  and  such  other  hazards,  causalities, 
liabilities and contingencies, and in such amounts and for such periods as set forth 
in Exhibit D, attached hereto and made a part hereof. All insurance policies and 
renewals  thereof  shall  be  issued  by  a  carrier  and  in  a  form  acceptable  to  City. 
Property insurance policies shall name City as an additional loss payee and liability 
insurance policies shall name City as additionally insured, as approved by City. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 71 of 498b.  Insurance  proceeds  and  condemnation  awards  for  any  loss  to  or  taking  of  the 
Development, or any portion thereof, shall be applied or utilized by Borrower as 
provided in the Deed of Trust executed by Borrower and referred to in the Recitals 
hereof. 

20. Annual Report.  Borrower shall file with City an annual report, as required by 24 CFR part 
92 and 25 Cal. Code of Regulations, Section 8218(a) (2) no later than ninety (90) days after 
the end of each fiscal year as established for the Development pursuant to Section 18(a) of 
this Agreement. The report shall contain a certification by Borrower as to such information 
as City may then require including, but not limited to the following: 

a.  The fiscal condition of the Development, including a financial statement for the 
previous fiscal year that includes a balance sheet and a profit and loss statement 
indicating any surplus or deficit in operating accounts; a detailed itemized listing 
of income and expenses; the amounts of any fiscal reserves and the total amount of 
Residual  Receipts  (defined  below)  received.  Such  financial  statement  shall  be 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of City. City may require that the 
financial statement be audited at Borrower’s expense by an independent certified 
public accountant acceptable to City or other person designed by City. 

b.  The substantial physical defects in the Development, including a description of any 
major repair or maintenance work undertaken or needed in the previous and current 
fiscal years. Such statement shall describe what steps Borrower has taken in order 
to maintain the Development in a safe and sanitary condition in accordance with 
applicable housing and building codes. 

c.  The occupancy of the Development indicating: 

1)  The verified income of each current household; and 

2)  The current rents charged each household and whether these rents include 

utilities. 

d.  General  management  performance,  including  tenant  relations  and  other  relevant 

information. 

e.  A  summary  of  the  information  received  from  the  re-certification  of  tenants’ 

incomes. 

f.  Evidence of a currently paid hazard and flood insurance policy, with loss payable 

to City in the amounts specified in Exhibit D.

21. City Review and Inspections. 

a.  Upon not less than forty-eight (48) hours’ notice to Borrower, City or its designee 
may, at any time during the term of the HOME Loan, enter and inspect the physical 
premises  and  inspect  all  accounting  records  pertaining  to  the  construction  or 
operation  of  the  Development.  Upon  request  by  City,  Borrower  shall  notify 
occupants of upcoming inspections of their units in accordance with State law. 

b.  City  may  perform  or  cause  to  be  performed  audits  of  any  and  all  phases  of 
Borrower’s activities related to the Development. At City’s request, Borrower shall 
provide,  at  its  own  expense,  an  audit  of  the  financial  condition  of  the  project 
certified by an independent certified public accountant. 

c.  City  may  request  any  other  information  that  it  deems  necessary  to  monitor 
compliance  with  requirements  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  and  the  Standard 
Agreement. Borrower shall promptly provide such information. 

22. Annual Operating Budget. 

a.  The fiscal year for the Development shall commence on January 1 and conclude on 

December 31. 

b.  No later than sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of each subsequent fiscal year 
of the Development, Borrower shall submit to City a proposed annual operating 
budget on a form provided by City. The proposed annual operating budget shall set 
forth Borrower’s estimate of the Development’s income, operating expenses and 
debt service for the upcoming year, reserves, proposed rent adjustments, and a year- 
to-date  operating  statement.  Annual  operating  budgets  and  rent  adjustments  are 
subject to approval by City. 

c.  Annual operating budgets are subject to written approval by City in accordance 
with the terms of the Subordination Agreement. Increases of three and one half 
percent  (3.5%)  or  less  in  the  total  operating  budget  and  increases  in  specific 
operating  expense  categories  (i.e.  renting  expenses,  special  expenses,  utility 
expenses, operations and maintenance expenses, taxes and insurance expenses) of 
three  and  one  half  percent  (3.5%)  or  less  shall  be  deemed  approved  by  City. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 73 of 498Borrower shall operate the Development in accordance with the approved annual 
budget. 

d.  Annual rent adjustments are subject to written approval by City. For the projects 
approved by City using High HOME rents, rent increases that do not exceed the 
upper  limits  for  High  HOME  rents  less  a  utility  allowance  shall  be  deemed 
approved by City. For projects approved by City using Low HOME rents less a 
utility allowance, rent increases that do not exceed the upper limits for Low HOME 
rents shall be deemed approved by City. For projects approved by City using rents 
below Low HOME rents, rent increases, which do not exceed the most, recently 
published annual Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, Residential Rent for All 
Urban Consumers for the West (CPI) shall be deemed approved by City. In the 
event this particular CPI index is no longer published, City shall select a similar 
index for this purpose. 

e.  Borrower  shall  operate  the  Development  in  accordance  with  the  First-Year 
Operating Budget approved by and on file with City. Such budget shall show all 
anticipated  income,  debt  service  and  expenses  for  management,  operations, 
reserves and maintenance for the first fiscal year or portion thereof following initial 
occupancy. 

23. Required Reserves. 

a.  Commencing  no  later  than  the  end  of  the  second  month  following  the  initial 
occupancy of the Development or such other date, as City shall designate in writing, 
Borrower  shall  establish  a  segregated  interest-bearing  Replacement  Reserve 
account in an F.D.I.C. or other comparable federally insured financial institution. 
Borrower shall make monthly deposits from Operating Income to the Replacement 
Reserve account in amounts as specified in the approved Initial Year Operating 
Budget and subsequent annual budgets. Initially, the annual deposit shall be Twelve 
Thousand Dollars and No Cents ($12,000.00) based on $500 per unit per year, or 
such other amount as approved by City in the Initial Year Operating Budget. City 
may review the adequacy of these monthly deposits on an annual basis, and require 
adjustments, as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at a date that is 
five (5) years from the Effective Date of this Agreement and every five (5) years 
thereafter, and at the request of City, Borrower shall engage the services of a third- 
party professional to prepare a physical needs assessment of the replacement needs 
of the Development. The annual deposit to the Replacement Reserve account shall 
be adjusted based upon the results of the physical needs assessment report. The cost 
for the report shall be an eligible expense from the Replacement Reserve account. 
Withdrawals are subject to approval by City and the Department and shall only be 
made for capital improvements, such as replacing or repairing structural elements, 
furniture, fixtures or equipment of the Development that are reasonably required to 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 74 of 498preserve  the  Development.  The  annual  deposit  required  under  the  Replacement 
Reserve  and  Security  Agreement  executed  in  connection  with  Borrower’s 
permanent financing is deemed to have satisfied the requirements under this Section 
so  long  as  the  annual  deposit  required  thereunder  is  consistent  with  the 
requirements herein. 

b.  Upon  receipt  of  the  fourth  installment  of  capital  contribution  from  Borrower’s 
investor limited partner (as such installment is made pursuant to the terms of the 
Partnership  Agreement),  Borrower  shall  establish  and  fully  fund  an  operating 
reserve account in the amount of Thirty-Seven Thousand Seven Hundred Eighty- 
Eight Dollars and No Cents ($37,788.00) (the “Operating Reserve”). The Operating 
Reserve accounts shall be held in an F.D.I.C. or other comparable federally insured

Development and use the same and the reserve funds for the operation and 
maintenance of the Development.

provisions of the Deed of Trust and State law regarding foreclosures.

cured within the time period set forth in such notice, the HOME Loan may 
not be accelerated hereunder if within said designated time period Borrower 
or any of Borrower’s limited partners has given written notice to City of 
Borrower’s  intention  to  cure  said  breach,  has  commenced  to  cure  such 
breach and has diligently prosecuted and effected such cure which shall be 
completed no later than sixty (60) days from the date notice of such breach 
is given. 

5)  City make seek such other remedies as may be available under law. 

b.  In the event that the breach or violation involves the rents to tenants or other charges 
in excess of those permitted under this Agreement, City may demand, and seek as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 80 of 498an additional remedy, the return of such excess rents or other charge to the affected 
household. 

c.  The remedies of City hereunder are cumulative, and the exercise of one or more of 
such remedies shall not be deemed an election of remedies and shall not preclude 
the exercise by City of any one or more of its other remedies. 

d.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any cure of any default or Event 
of Default made or tendered by a limited partner of Borrower shall be deemed to 
be a cure by Borrower and shall be accepted or rejected on the same basis as if 
made or tendered by Borrower. Copies of all notices which are sent to Borrower 
under  the  terms  of  this  Agreement  shall  also  be  sent  to  Borrower’s  managing 
general partner and Borrower’s limited partner(s) as defined in Section 41.

to act on its behalf in monitoring compliance and enforcing the provisions hereof. 

33. Amendment.  This Agreement shall not be altered or amended except in writing, executed 

between the Parties.

unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof 
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 

35. Binding on Successors.  This Agreement shall bind, and the benefits thereof shall inure to, 
the  respective  parties  hereto,  their  legal  representatives,  executors,  administrators, 
successors in the office of interest, and assigns, provided, however, that Borrower may not 
assign this Agreement or any of its obligations hereunder, voluntarily or by operation of 
law, without the prior written approval of City and the Department. 

36. Recording Agreement.  This Agreement, and all amendments thereto, shall be executed by 
each of the Parties. This Agreement, or memorandum thereof, shall be recorded against the 
subject Property in the Official Records of Sutter County.

hold  harmless  City  and  its  respective  agents,  employees  and  officers  from  any  and  all 
claims, losses, liabilities or causes of actions (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising 
from  or  in  connection  with  Borrower’s  management,  maintenance  or  operation  of  the 
Development.

consent: 

Release any person liable for payment of all or any part of the indebtedness, or 
for performance of any obligation; 

Make  any  agreement  extending  the  time  or  otherwise  altering  the  terms  of

additional  securities,  Beneficiary  may,  at  its  option,  exhaust  any  one  or  more  of  said

such order as it may determine, and may apply the proceeds received upon the indebtedness

other security including the Security hereunder and without waiving any breach or default 
of any right or power, whether exercised hereunder or contained herein, or in any such 
other security.

Packet Page 105 of 49814. This Deed of Trust shall not construed to create a security interest under the provisions of 
the Uniform Commercial Code, as same together with any amendments or supplements 
thereto may be in effect, with respect to any goods, equipment, appliances, bank accounts, 
account receivables, inventory or articles of personal property now attached to or used or 
hereafter to be attached to or used in connection with the Development. 

 
15. That  acceptance  by  Beneficiary  of  any  sum  in  payment,  or  part  payment,  of  any 
indebtedness secured hereby, after the same is due or after the recording of a Notice of 
Default, shall not constitute a waiver of the right to require prompt payment, when due, of 
all other sums so secured, nor shall such acceptance cure or waive any remaining default 
or  invalidate  any  sale  held  pursuant  to  such  Notice  for  any  such  remaining  default,  or 
prejudice any of the rights of Beneficiary under this Deed of Trust. 

 
16. That Beneficiary may, at any time Beneficiary may desire, appoint another Trustee in the 
place and stead of said Trustee or any successor in trust, and the title herein conveyed to 
said Trustee shall be vested in said successor, which appointment shall be in writing and 
shall be duly recorded in the Recorder’s Office of Sutter County. 

 
17. That the trusts herein created are irrevocable. 
 
18. That  default  under  the  terms  of  any  instrument  evidencing  and  debt  secured  by  an 
encumbrance senior or prior to this instrument shall, after the expiration of any applicable 
cure periods, constitute a default hereunder. 

 
19. That  upon  the  request  of  Trustor  or  Trustor’s  successors  in  ownership  of  the  land, 
Beneficiary may hereafter, at its option, at any time before full payment of the indebtedness 
secured hereby, make further advances to Trustor or said successors in ownership, and the 
same, with interest and late charges, if any, shall be secured by this Deed of Trust; provided, 
that if Beneficiary, at its option, shall make a further advance or advances as aforesaid, 
Trustor or said successors in ownership agree, upon request of Beneficiary, to execute and 
deliver to Beneficiary a note to evidence the same, payable on or before that maturity of 
the indebtedness secured hereby and bearing such other terms as Beneficiary shall require. 

 
20. That default in the terms of the City Loan Agreement and the Regulatory Agreement and 
any  other  instrument  securing  the  debt  secured  hereby  shall,  after  expiration  of  any 
applicable cure periods, constitute a default in this Deed of Trust. 

 
21. That the invalidity of any one or more covenants, phrases, clauses, sentences or paragraphs 
of this Deed of Trust shall not affect the remaining portions of this Deed of Trust or any 
part thereof and this Deed of Trust shall be construed as if such invalid covenants, phrases, 
clauses, sentences or paragraphs, if any, had not been inserted herein. 

 
22. Trustor agrees to pay Beneficiary’s charges for the preparation of any financial or loan 
statements regarding the obligations secured by this Deed of Trust requested by Trustor or 

 

Packet Page 106 of 498on its behalf. 

 

 
23. If the Property is income property, Trustor, at the request of Beneficiary, shall deliver to 
Beneficiary  Trustor’s  signed copies of  all  leases,  or  executed  counterparts  thereof,  now 
existing  or  hereafter  made  affecting  all  or  any  part  of  the  Property.  Trustor  shall  not, 
without  Beneficiary’s  written  consent  (which  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld  or 
delayed), permit an assignment of any lease or request or consent to the subordination of 
any lease of all or any part of the Property to any lien subordinate to this Deed of Trust. If 
Trustor becomes aware that any tenant proposes to do, or is doing, any act or thing which 
may give rise to any right of set-off against rent, Trustor shall, subject to any limitations in 
§42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if applicable: (i) take such steps as 
shall be reasonably calculated to prevent the accrual of any right to a set-off against rent, 
and (ii) take such steps as shall effectively discharge such set-off and as shall effectively 
assure that rents thereafter due shall continue to be payable without set-off or deduction. 
Upon Beneficiary’s taking possession of the Property by receiver or otherwise, Trustor 
shall be deemed to have assigned to Beneficiary all leases now existing or hereafter made 
of all or any part of the Property and all leases now existing or hereafter made of all or any 
part of the Property and all security deposits made by tenants in connection with such leases 
now existing or hereafter made by tenants in connection with such leases of the Property 
for so long as Beneficiary remains in possession; thereupon, Beneficiary shall have all of 
the rights and powers possessed by Trustor prior thereto and Beneficiary shall have the 
right  to  modify,  extend  or  terminate  such  existing  leases  and  to  execute  new  leases,  in 
Beneficiary’s reasonable determination. 

 
24. If Trustor shall voluntarily file a petition under the Federal Bankruptcy Act, as such Act 
may  from  time  to  time  be  amended,  or  under  any  similar  successor  Federal  statute 
relating  to  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  arrangements  or  reorganizations,  or  under  any  state 
bankruptcy or  insolvency  act,  or  file  an  answer  in  an involuntary  proceeding  admitting 
insolvency or inability to pay debts, or if Trustor shall fail to obtain a vacation or stay of 
involuntary  proceedings  brought  for  the  reorganization,  dissolution  or  liquidation  of 
Trustor  within  sixty  (60)  days  from  the  date  when  such  proceedings  are  brought,  or  if 
Trustor  shall  be  adjudged bankrupt,  or  if  a  trustee  or  receiver  shall  be  appointed  for 
Trustor or Trustor’s Property, of if the Property shall become subject to the jurisdiction of 
a Federal bankruptcy court or similar state court, or if Trustor shall make an assignment 
for the benefit of Trustor’s creditors, or if there is an attachment, execution or other judicial 
seizure of any portion of Trustor’s assets and such seizure is not discharged within thirty 
(30) days, then Beneficiary may, at Beneficiary’s option, declare all of the sums secured 
by this Deed of Trust to be immediately due and payable without prior notice to Trustor, 
and Beneficiary may invoke any remedies permitted by this Deed of Trust. Any reasonable 
attorneys’ fees and other reasonable expenses incurred by Beneficiary in connection with 
Trustor’s bankruptcy or any of the other aforesaid events shall be additional indebtedness 
of Trustor secured by this Deed of Trust. 

 
25. Should Trustor sell, convey, transfer or dispose of the Property, or any part thereof, or any 

 

 

Packet Page 107 of 498interest therein, or place any lien or encumbrance thereon subordinate to the lien created 
hereby, or agree to do so (whether voluntarily or by any operation of law), without the 
written consent of Beneficiary being first obtained, except as permitted in the Agreement, 
Beneficiary shall have the right, at its option, to declare all sums secured hereby forthwith 
due and payable. This option may be exercised at any time after the occurrence of such 
event and the acceptance of one or more installments from any person thereafter shall not 
constitute a waiver of Beneficiary’s option. Consent to one such transaction shall not be 
deemed  to  be  a  waiver  of  the  right  to  require  such  consent  to  future  or  successive 
transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereinabove, the respective interests 
of  the  Borrower’s  limited  partners  shall  be  transferrable  without  the  consent  of  the 
Beneficiary. Moreover, the limited partners of Trustor shall be permitted to remove and 
replace one or more general partners but only in accordance with the terms of the Loan 
Agreement. 

 
26. Notwithstanding  the  existence  of  any  other  security  interest(s)  in  the  Security  held  by 
Beneficiary or by any other party, Beneficiary shall have the right to determine the order 
in  which  any  or  all  of  the  Security  shall  be  subjected  to  the  remedies  provided  herein. 
Beneficiary shall have the right to determine the order in which any or all portions of the 
indebtedness secured hereby are satisfied from the proceeds realized upon the exercise of 
the remedies provided herein. Trustor, any party who consents to this Deed of Trust and 
any party who now or hereafter acquires a security interest in the Security, or any part 
thereof, and who has actual or constructive notice hereof, hereby waives any and all rights 
to require the marshaling of assets in connection with the exercise of any of the remedies 
permitted by applicable law or provided herein. 

 
27. Casualty: 
 

 

 

a.  Definitions.  For purposes of this Section 27, the following terms and phrases shall 

have the meanings indicated: 

i.  “Restoration”  means  the restoration, repair,  replacement  or  rebuilding of  the 
Property and/or the Development to a value, condition and character equal  to 
or  greater  than  that  immediately  prior  to  the  damage,  destruction  or 
“Taking”, as defined below. 

 
ii.  “Taking”  means  the  taking  of  all  or  any  part  of  the  Property  and/or  the 
Development, or any interest therein or right accruing thereto, as the result of 
the exercise of the right of condemnation or eminent domain, or change of grade 
affecting the Property or the Development, or any part thereof. A  conveyance 
in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of any such right of condemnation or 
eminent domain shall be considered a Taking. 

b.  Repair.  In case of any damage to the Property or the Development, or any part 
thereof, if the reasonable cost of Restoration (any temporary repairs and protection 

 

Packet Page 108 of 498pending commencement of the Restoration) exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars and 
No Cents ($50,000.00), Trustor will promptly give written notice of such damage 
to Beneficiary, describing the nature and extent of such damage and setting forth 
the  best  estimate  of  the  cost  of  Restoration  (and  such  temporary  repairs  and 
protection). In case of any damage to the Property or the Development, or any part 
thereof,  Trustor  at  its  expense  shall  promptly  commence  and  complete  the 
Restoration provided that the Net Casualty Insurance Proceeds (defined below) are 
made available to Trustor. All insurance proceeds on account of any damage to the 
Property and/or Development shall be payable to, and deposited with, Beneficiary. 
Subject to the conditions set forth below, Beneficiary shall request from Trustor the 
estimate of  cost of Restoration, which Restoration shall be accomplished by the 
Trustor  if  Beneficiary  receives  satisfactory  guarantees  from  Trustor  that  when 
combined with the insurance proceeds held by Beneficiary, the Restoration can be 
accomplished  such  that  the  value  of  Beneficiary's  lien  is  not  impaired.  If 
Restoration as provided herein is not determined by Beneficiary to be available due 
to insufficient funds and/or lack of adequate guaranties and prompt action by the 
Trustor, Beneficiary, at its sole option, (i) may apply such insurance proceeds upon 
the  Note,  as  the  Beneficiary  may  determine,  (ii)  may  release  such  insurance 
proceeds, without reducing the principal balance of the Note, to Trustor, or (iii) 
may divide any such amount in any manner among any such application, use or 
release.  No  such  application,  use  or  release  shall,  however,  cure  or  waive  any 
default under the Agreement or invalidate any act done pursuant to a Notice of 
Default.  Any  unapplied,  undisbursed  insurance  proceeds  remaining  with  the 
Beneficiary shall inure to the benefit of and pass to the owner or purchaser of the 
Property or any part of it at any foreclosure or trustee’s sale under the Agreement. 

c.  Application.  In the event that Trustor requests that the insurance proceeds be used 
to accomplish the Restoration, then any “Net Casualty Insurance Proceeds” (i.e., 
the casualty insurance proceeds remaining after reimbursement of the Beneficiary 
for  any  reasonable  costs  and  expenses  of  the  Beneficiary,  including  reasonable 
attorneys’ fees, for collection thereof) received by the Beneficiary shall be applied 
to the cost of Restoration and disbursed in the same manner and subject to the same 
conditions as the Project Funds (as defined in the Agreement) but only if each of the 
following  conditions  is  satisfied:  (A)  no  default  or  potential  default  exists 
hereunder; (B) the Net Casualty Insurance Proceeds, together with such  additional 
funds  (the  “Required  Equity  Funds”)  as  Trustor  shall  have  deposited  with  the 
Beneficiary  (and  which  the  Trustor  shall  be  required  to  deposit  with  the 
Beneficiary  within  one  hundred  twenty  (120)  days  after  the  occurrence  of  such 
casualty), are sufficient, in the reasonable judgment of the Beneficiary, to pay all 
costs of (1) the Restoration and (2) interest under the Note and any other expenses 
related to the Development; (C) the anticipated date for completion of Restoration 
shall, in the reasonable judgment of the Beneficiary, be prior to the date which is 
six (6) months prior to the then-applicable maturity date of the Note; and (D) each 
of the insurance companies from which the Net Casualty Insurance Proceeds are 

 

 

Packet Page 109 of 498received  shall  have  waived  in  writing  all  right  of  subrogation  for  the  benefit  of 
Trustor and the Beneficiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the value of 
Beneficiary’s lien is unimpaired, the Net Casualty Insurance Proceeds shall be used 
for Restoration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 27(c) shall be subject 
to the terms of the Subordination Agreement. 

 
28. Condemnation.  Subject  to  the  terms  of  the  Subordination Agreement,  in  the  event  of  a 
partial Taking such that the Development is subject to Restoration, all proceeds and awards 
shall be paid to Beneficiary to accomplish the Restoration in the event that Trustor requests 
and satisfies the conditions for the same; and such amount shall be disbursed as set forth 
in  Section  27(c)  (as  the  same  applies  to  the  application  of  the  Net  Casualty  Insurance 
Proceeds, with each reference therein to insurance proceeds deemed to include a reference 
to  condemnation  proceeds  and  awards).  In  the  event  of  a  total  Taking  or  in  the  event 
Borrower does not elect to apply such award or proceeds to the Restoration, such amount 
shall be applied as follows, in the order of priority indicated: 

a.  To  reimburse  Beneficiary  for  all  reasonable  costs  and  expenses,  including 
reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with collecting such proceeds; 

 

 
b.  To the payment of the accrued and unpaid interest on the Note; 
 
c.  To the payment of the unpaid principal of the Note; and 
 
d.  Any remaining balance, to the Trustor. 

 
29. Cure by Limited Partner.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any cure of any 
default  or  Event  of  Default  made  or  tendered  by  a  limited  partner  of  Borrower  (or  an 
affiliate thereof) shall be deemed to be a cure by Borrower and shall be accepted or rejected 
on the same basis as if made or tendered by Borrower. Copies of all notices which are sent 
to Borrower under the terms of this Agreement shall also be sent to Borrower’s limited 
partners. 

 
30. Superiority of Regulatory Agreement.  Borrower covenants that it has not, and shall not, 
enter into or execute any other agreement with provisions contrary to the provisions of the 
Regulatory  Agreement  or  contrary  to  the  intent  of  maintaining  the  affordability  of  the 
Property for the full Period of Affordability. The HOME Regulatory Agreement is superior 
to this Deed of Trust. 

 
UPON WRITTEN REQUEST OF BENEFICIARY stating that all sums secured hereby 
have  been  paid,  and  upon  surrender  of  this  Deed  of  Trust  and  the  Note  to  Trustee  for 
cancellation  and  retention  and  upon  payment  by  Trustor  of  its  fees,  Trustee  shall  reconvey, 
without  warranty,  the  estate  in  the  Property  then  held  by  Trustee.  The  grantee  in  such 
reconveyance  may  be  designated  and  described  as  the  “person  or  persons  legally  entitled 

 

Packet Page 110 of 498thereto”, or by other appropriate terms. 

This  Deed  of  Trust  shall  inure  to  and  bind  the  heirs,  legatees,  devisees,  administrators, 
executors, successors and assigns of the parties hereto, and shall be so construed that wherever 
applicable  with  reference  to  any  of  the  parties  hereto,  the  use  of  the  singular  number  shall 
include the plural number, the use of the plural number shall include the singular number, the  use 
of  the  masculine  gender  shall  include  the  feminine  gender,  and shall  likewise  be  so construed 
as applicable to and including a corporation or corporations that may be a party or  parties hereto. 
The term Beneficiary shall mean the owner and holder of the Note secured  hereby, whether or 
not named as Beneficiary herein. 

TRUSTOR hereby requests that a copy of any Notice of Default and of any Notice of Sale 
hereunder be mailed to it, as well as the limited partner(s) as the addresses hereinbefore set forth:

HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM (HOME) 

REGULATORY AGREEMENT 
LOAN NUMBER 16-HOME-11532 

THIS REGULATORY AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is made and entered into this 1st day of 
August, 2019 (the “Effective Date”), by and between Live Oak Pacific Associates II, a California 
Limited Partnership (“Borrower”), and the City of Live Oak, a municipal corporation of the State 
of California (“City”). Borrower and City are referred to collectively herein as the  “Parties”. 

Recitals 

A.  Borrower is the owner of real property located in the City of Live Oak, California and more 

fully described in Exhibit A (the “Property”). 

B.  Borrower has proposed to develop the Property by constructing thereon a 24-unit rental 
housing  development  of  which  24  units  will  be  Assisted  Units  (defined  below)  to  be 
occupied by Low Income Households (the “Development”). 

C.  The Development will be financed in whole or in part and regulated by a permanent loan 
from City in a principal amount of not to exceed Four Million Five Hundred Thousand 
Dollars and No Cents ($4,500,000.00) (the “HOME Loan”) from the Home Investment 
Partnerships  Program  (the  “HOME  Program”).  The  HOME  Loan  will  be  provided  to 
Borrower by City in accordance with 42 USC 12741 et seq., 24 CFR Part 92, California 
Health and Safety Section 50896 and Title 25, California Code of Regulations, Sections 
8200  through  8220,  (together,  the  “HOME  Regulations”).  In  consideration  of  City’s 
commitment to make the HOME Loan provided that HOME Program funds are available 
to City, City and the California Department of Housing and Community Development (the 
“Department”)  have  entered  into  a  Standard  Agreement  No.  16-HOME-11532  dated 
December  28,  2017.  The  proceeds  of  the  HOME  Loan  shall  be  disbursed,  used  and 
governed by the City Loan Agreement by and between City and Borrower of even date 
herewith (“City Loan Agreement”). 

D.  The  Standard  Agreement  and  the  City  Loan  Agreement,  including  all  exhibits  and 
attachments hereto, are incorporated in full by reference into this Agreement. In the event 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 116 of 498of any inconsistencies between the terms set forth in the City Loan Agreement and the 
terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. 

E.  Borrower agrees to abide by all provisions of the Standard Agreement and the City Loan 
Agreement with respect to the Development. Borrower shall execute a promissory note 
evidencing its obligation to repay the HOME Loan (the “Note”) and a deed of trust in favor 
of City to be recorded against Borrower’s interest in the Property securing repayment of 
the Note (the “Deed of Trust”). Borrower agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions 
of the Note and Deed of Trust. The Note, the Deed of Trust, the Standard Agreement, the 
City  Loan  Agreement,  the  Subordination  Agreement  dated  September        ,  2019  (the 
“Subordination Agreement”), and this Agreement are collectively referred to herein as  the 
“HOME Loan Documents”. 

F.  As further consideration for the HOME Loan and in furtherance of the purposes of the 
HOME Program, Borrower has agreed to enter into this Agreement. The purpose of this 
Agreement  is  to  regulate  and  restrict  occupancy,  rents,  operations,  ownership  and 
management  of  the  Development  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  HOME 
Program. 

G.  The Borrower has agreed to pay an Annual Monitoring Fee and has included said fee in

Program,  including  the  statutes,  the  HOME  Regulations  and  such  policies  and 
procedures  of  City,  the  Department  and  HUD  pertaining  thereto.  Borrower 
acknowledges  that  it  is  familiar  with  such  applicable  provisions  and  has  been 
professionally advised to the extent necessary for the purpose of enabling Borrower 
to fully comply with such provisions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 120 of 498b.  The financial assistance provided under the HOME Program is governed by 24 
CFR Part 92. With respect to the assistance, Borrower agrees to comply with all 
requirements  and  obligations  as  described  in  24  CFR  Part  92,  as  well  as  all 
provisions governing the use of HOME funds. Borrower further agrees to comply 
with the directives of City as necessary to ensure compliance with the obligations 
of City as set forth in its agreements with HUD and/or the Department regarding 
the use of HOME funds. 

c.  City acknowledges that the Development is being developed and operated so that 
one hundred percent (100%) of the units (other than the unit occupied by resident 
managers) will qualify for low income housing tax credits under Section 42 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (“LIHTCs”). City agrees 
that nothing in the HOME Loan Documents shall require Borrower to violate the 
requirements of Section 42 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated 
thereunder,  or  to  operate  the  Development  in  a  manner  that  would  prevent  one 
hundred  percent  (100%)  of  the  units  (other  than  units  occupied  by  resident 
managers) from qualifying for LIHTCs. 

5.  Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall commence upon its recordation in 
the Official Records of Sutter County and remain in full force and effect and apply to the 
Development through and including the date which is fifty-five (55) years from the date of 
“Project Completion” as specified at 24 CFR 92.2, regardless of any prepayment of the 
HOME  Loan  or  sale,  assignment,  transfer  or  conveyance  of  the  Development,  unless 
terminated  earlier  by  City  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  this  Agreement  or  extended  by  the 
mutual  consent  of  the  Parties.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  this  Agreement  shall 
terminate  upon  the  involuntary  non-compliance  with  the  provisions  of  this  Agreement 
caused by fire, seizure, change in federal law or action of a federal agency after the date 
hereof which prevents City from enforcing the provisions hereof, or condemnation or a 
similar event; provided, however, that the preceding provisions of this sentence shall cease 
to apply and the restrictions contained herein shall be reinstated if, at any time subsequent 
to  the  termination  of  such  provisions,  Borrower  or  any  related  person  to  it  (within  the 
meaning of Section 1.103-10(e) of the Treasury Regulations) obtains an ownership interest 
in the Developer for federal income tax purposes. 

6.  Assisted  Unit  Schedule.  Upon  occupancy  following  the  completion  of  construction, 
Borrower  shall  rent  Assisted  Unit  in  accordance  with  this  Agreement,  the  Schedule  of 
Assisted Units set forth in Exhibits B and E, attached hereto and incorporated herein. 

7.  Tenant Selection Standards. Borrower shall rent Assisted Units in the Development only 
to Eligible Households in accordance with the Management Plan approved by and on file 
with City pursuant to this section. Such Management Plan  may be periodically altered 
and such alteration must be submitted to and approved by City prior to use. At all times, a 
minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the Assisted Units must 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 121 of 498be rented to Very Low Income Households and, at initial occupancy, no less than ninety 
percent (90%) of the Assisted Units shall be occupied by households whose incomes are at 
sixty percent (60%) and below of Area Median Income, unless stricter limitations are set 
forth in Exhibits B and E, attached hereto and incorporated herein. The Management Plan 
shall  include  among  other  things:  (1)  detailed  actions  to  be  taken  by  Borrower  to 
affirmatively market vacant units in a manner which ensures equal access to all persons in 
any  category  protected  by  federal,  state  or  local  laws  governing  discrimination,  and 
regardless  of  any  arbitrary  factor;  (2)  specific  reasonable  criteria  for  determination  of 
tenant eligibility, including household size in accordance with the minimum occupancy 
standard specified in the HOME Regulations; (3) a requirement that eligible tenants be 
selected based on order of applications, lottery, or other reasonable method approved by 
City; (4) specific procedures through which tenant applicants deemed to be ineligible shall 
be notified of the reason for their ineligibility and may appeal this determination; (5) a 
requirement for maintenance of a waiting list of eligible applicants; (6) specific procedures 
for obtaining information regarding prospective tenants’ incomes as necessary to certify 
that such income does not exceed the lower or very low income limit; and (7) affirmative 
fair housing marketing procedures as specified in the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing 
Plan Compliance Regulations of HUD, 24 CFR Part 200.620(a)-(c), or similar affirmative 
fair housing marketing plan as approved by City. 

8.  Period of Affordability.  “Period of Affordability” means a period of the years as listed 
below beginning from the date of Project Completion as defined by 24 CFR 92.2 wherein 
the Development must meet the affordability requirements contained herein. The period of 
years shall consist of the Federal period of affordability (the “Federal Period”) and the State 
period of affordability (the “State Period”) which shall run concurrently from the date of 
Project Completion. The Federal Period is a term of twenty (20) years, and the State Period 
is  a  term  of  fifty-five  (55)  years.  The  Federal  Period  is  established  by  HOME  Federal 
Regulations (the “Final Rule”), 24 CFR 92.254(e), and the State Period is established by 
HOME Investment Partnership Program Regulations section 8208 in effect as of March 
26, 1996. 

9.  Marketing Plan. 

a.  Borrower shall prepare and implement a Marketing Plan, subject to prior approval 
by  City,  which  approval  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld  or  delayed,  which 
specifies how Borrower intends to market the Development to prospective tenants 
in the Development’s market area. The Marketing Plan shall specifically address 
how Borrower intends to market the Development to underserved populations in 
Development market area and the frequency of marketing efforts. City agrees that 
Borrower may utilize the HUD 935.2 Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan for 
these purposes. 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 122 of 498b.  Borrower agrees to evaluate the effectiveness of the Marketing Plan in reaching 
underserved populations on an annual basis and to revise it as necessary to better 
reach underserved populations that are not being reached. The revised Marketing 
Plan  shall  be  submitted  to  City  for  approval,  which  approval  shall  not  be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed, prior to implementation. 

10. Nondiscrimination.  Borrower  shall  not  discriminate  against  any  tenant  or  prospective 
tenant on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, familial 
status, nor any other arbitrary factor in violation of any state, federal or local law governing 
discrimination in rental housing. 

11. Rental Agreement and Occupancy Procedures (the “Lease”). 

a.  Each Eligible Household selected to occupy a unit in the Development shall enter 
into  a  written  rental  agreement  with  Borrower  on  a  form  approved  by  City, 
containing such provisions as are required by the HOME Regulations (the “Lease”). 
The Lease shall be for a term of not less than one (1) year unless a shorter term is 
mutually agreed upon between Borrower and tenant. 

b.  Each Lease shall not contain any of the following provisions: 

1)  Agreement by the tenant to be sued, to admit guilt, or to a judgment in favor 
of Borrower or Borrower’s agent in a lawsuit brought in connection with 
the Lease; 

2)  Agreement  by  the  tenant  that  Borrower  may  take,  hold,  or  sell  personal 
property of household members without notice to the tenant and a court 
decision on the rights of the parties. This prohibition, however, does not 
apply  to  an  agreement  by  the  tenant  concerning  disposition  of  personal 
property remaining in the housing unit after the tenant has moved out of the 
unit. Borrower may dispose of this personal property in accordance with 
State law; 

3)  Agreement by the tenant not to hold Borrower or Borrower’s agents legally 
responsible for any action or failure to act, whether intentional or negligent; 

4)  Agreement of the tenant that Borrower or Borrower’s Agent may institute a 

lawsuit without notice to the tenant; 

5)  Agreement by the tenant that Borrower or Borrower’s agent may evict the 
tenant or household members without instituting a civil court proceeding in 
which the tenant has the opportunity to present a defense, or before a court 
decision on the rights of the parties; 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 123 of 4986)  Agreement by the tenant to waive any right to a trial by jury; 

7)  Agreement by the tenant to waive tenant’s right to appeal, or to otherwise 

challenge in court, a court decision in connection with the Lease; and 

8)  Agreement by the tenant to pay attorneys’ fees or other legal costs even if 
the tenant wins in a court proceeding by the owner against the tenant. The 
tenant, however, may be obligated to pay costs if the tenant loses. 

c.  Borrower  shall  establish reasonable rules  of  conduct and  occupancy.  Such  rules 
shall be consistent with state law and the HOME Regulations. Said rules shall be in 
writing and shall be given to each tenant upon occupancy. Any change shall become 
effective no fewer than thirty (30) days after giving written notice thereof to each 
household. 

d.  Borrower shall not terminate the tenancy or refuse to renew the Lease of a tenant 
of rental housing assisted with HOME funds except for serious or repeated violation 
of the terms and conditions of the Lease; for violation of tenancy period; or for 
other  good  cause.  Any  termination  or  refusal  to  renew  a  Lease  shall  be  by  the 
owner’s service upon the tenant of a written notice in compliance with State law 
and specifying the grounds for the action. 

e.  Borrower shall maintain the premises in compliance with all applicable housing 

quality standards and local code requirements.  

12. Rents. 

a.  For  all  Assisted  Units,  Rents  shall  not  exceed  High  HOME  Rents  less  a  utility 
allowance. For Assisted Units that are set-aside for Very Low Income Households, 
HOME rents shall not exceed Low HOME Rents less a utility allowance. 

b.  A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of all Assisted Units shall be occupied by 
Very Low Income Households at Rents that are no greater than the Low HOME 
Rents less a utility allowance, unless stricter limitations are set forth in Exhibits B 
and E, attached hereto and incorporated herein. 

c.  Any  household  certified  as  an  Eligible  Household  upon  occupancy  but  whose 
income  increases  above  the  eligibility  level  must  pay  as  Rent  the  lesser  of  the 
amount payable by the tenant under State or local law or thirty percent (30%) of 
the household’s adjusted monthly income; except that, Assisted Units subject to 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 124 of 498low-income tax credit rules under Section 42 of the Code shall be governed by such 
rules. 

d.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  or  any  other  requirements  and/or  restriction 
contained herein, the Rent charged on the Assisted Units shall not exceed the rent 
applicable  to  an  individual  or  family  qualifying  under  the  percentage  of  Area 
Median  Income  as  follows:  Twelve  (12)  Assisted  Units  shall  be  rented  at  forty 
percent (40%) of Area Median Income and Twelve (12) Assisted Units shall be 
rented at fifty percent (50%) of Area Median Income. See Exhibit E for specifics. 

13. Security Deposits. 

a.  Security deposits shall be required of tenants only in accordance with State law and 

this Agreement.

separate and apart from all other funds of the Development in a trust account with 
a depository insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (F.D.I.C.), or 
other  comparable  federal  deposit  insurance  program,  and  shall  be  held  and 
disbursed in accordance with State law. The balance of such account shall at all 
times  equal  or  exceed  the  aggregate  of  all  outstanding  obligations  under  said 
account, plus accrued interest thereon. 

14. Certification of Tenant Income and Household Size. 

a.  The income and household size of all households occupying Assisted Units shall 
be certified by Borrower prior to occupancy and re-certified annually thereafter in 
a manner approved by City and specified in the Development’s Management Plan. 

b.  If  the  income  of  a  tenant  upon  re-certification  exceeds  the  upper  limit  for  Low 
Income  Households,  and  there  are  no  other requirements  statutorily  imposed  by 
another federal or State funding source or tax credit program, including Section 42 
of the code, that tenant shall not have his or her Lease terminated as a result thereof, 
but shall be charged Rents as provided in Section 12 (c). 

c.  Subject  to  Section  14(b),  where  a  household  occupying  a  unit  designated  for 
occupancy by a Very Low Income Household no longer so qualifies at the time of 
re-certification,  but  qualifies  as  an  otherwise  Eligible  Household,  the  Rent 
appropriated for that income level shall be charged. 

d.  City  acknowledges  that  the  household  size  appropriate  for  each  unit  shall  be 

determined according to the LIHTC rules and regulations.

c.  If,  upon  re-certification,  the  income  of  a  household  occupying an  Assisted  Unit 
reserved for occupancy by Low Income Households exceeds the upper limit for 
Low  Income,  Borrower  may  designate  such  household’s  unit  as  a  non-Assisted 
Unit, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied: 

1)  Not  later  than  the  date  Borrower  designates  the  unit  as  non-Assisted, 
Borrower  also  makes  available  a  comparable  vacant  unit  previously 
designated  as  non-Assisted  to  be  designated  as  an  Assisted  Unit,  or 
designates  a  previously  non-Assisted  Unit  occupied  by  a  Low  Income 
Household as an Assisted Unit, or agrees to occupy the next available unit 
with a Low Income Household; and 

2)  The Rent charged for the newly designated Assisted Unit will not exceed 

the High HOME Rent as shown in Exhibit E attached hereto. 

d.  Subject to the limitations imposed by Exhibit E, where a household occupying an 
Assisted Unit reserved for occupancy by Very Low Income Households no longer 
qualifies as Very Low Income at the time of re-certification, but qualifies as a Low 
Income Household, the following shall apply: 

1)  Borrower  shall  designate  the  unit  as  an  Assisted  Unit  for  Low  Income

16. Rental Agreement and Grievance Procedures. 

The  rental  agreement  and  grievance  procedures  shall  be  in  accordance  with  California 
Code of Regulations, Title 25, Division 1, Chapter 7, Subchapter 19, Section 8307. 

a.  One-year Term. All rental or occupancy agreements for HOME-assisted units shall 
be for a term of not less than one (1) year unless by mutual agreement between the 
tenant and Borrower. 

b.  City Approval. All rental or occupancy agreements shall be on a form approved by 

City and shall include the following: 

1)  Provisions requiring good cause for termination of tenancy; 

2)  A provision requiring that the facts constituting the grounds for any eviction 

be set forth in the notice provided to the tenant pursuant to state law; 

3)  A  notice  of  grievance  procedures  for  hearing  complaints  of  tenants  and

4)  A requirement that the tenant actually recertify household income and size. 

17. Foreclosure after Development Completion. Borrower promises, covenants, warrants and 
represents that it shall complete the Development. Whether or not the Development is in 
fact completed shall be solely determined by the City. Should the Development in fact have 
been  completed,  then  the  Period  of  Affordability  shall  terminate  upon  foreclosure  or 
transfer  in  lieu  of  foreclosure,  except  that  the  affordability restrictions shall  be  revived 
according to the original terms if, (a) during the original Period of Affordability, the owner

the former owner or those with whom the former owner has or had family business ties, 
obtains an ownership interest in the Development or the Property, or if (b) the foreclosing 
entity or transferee in lieu of foreclosure assumes in writing and agrees to be bound by the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 127 of 498terms of the HOME Standard Agreement and the HOME Loan Documents, as that term is 
defined in the HOME Standard Agreement. 

18. Maintenance and Management. 

a.  Borrower is specifically responsible for all maintenance, repair and management 
functions for the Development, including without limitation, selection of tenants, 
re-certification of household income and size, evictions, collection of rents, routine 
and extraordinary repairs and replacement of capital items. Borrower shall maintain 
all units and common areas in a safe and sanitary manner in accordance with local 
health, building, and housing codes, HUD housing quality standards pursuant to 24 
CFR Section 882.109, and the Management Plan described above. 

b.  Borrower may, with the prior written approval of City, contract with a management 
agent  for  the  performance  of  the  services  or  duties  required  in  Section  18(a). 
However,  such  an  arrangement  does  not  relieve  Borrower  of  responsibility  for 
proper  performance  of  these  duties.  Such  contract  shall  contain  a  provision 
allowing Borrower to terminate the contract without penalty upon no more than 
thirty  day’s  (30)  notice.  Upon  a  determination  by  City,  and  notice  to  Borrower 
thereof,  that  the  management  agent  has  failed  to  operate  the  Development  in 
accordance with this Agreement, Borrower shall exercise such right of termination 
forthwith and shall make immediate arrangements, which shall be subject to City 
approval, for continuing performance of the requirements of this Agreement. 

c.  Borrower may operate the Development itself only with prior written approval of 
City.  Subject  to  the  terms  of  the  Subordination  Agreement  and  upon  a 
determination by City and notice to Borrower thereof, that Borrower has failed to 
operate  the  Development  in  accordance  with  this  Agreement,  City  may  require 
Borrower to contract with management agent to operate the Development, or to 
make such other arrangements as City deems necessary to ensure performance of 
the requirements of this Agreement. 

19. Hazard and Liability Insurance. 

a.  Borrower shall at all times keep the Development insured against loss by fire, flood 
(as  required  pursuant  to  24  CFR  92.358),  and  such  other  hazards,  causalities, 
liabilities and contingencies, and in such amounts and for such periods as set forth 
in Exhibit D, attached hereto and made a part hereof. All insurance policies and 
renewals  thereof  shall  be  issued  by  a  carrier  and  in  a  form  acceptable  to  City. 
Property insurance policies shall name City as an additional loss payee and liability 
insurance policies shall name City as additionally insured, as approved by City. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 128 of 498b.  Insurance  proceeds  and  condemnation  awards  for  any  loss  to  or  taking  of  the 
Development, or any portion thereof, shall be applied or utilized by Borrower as 
provided in the Deed of Trust executed by Borrower and referred to in the Recitals 
hereof. 

20. Annual Report.  Borrower shall file with City an annual report, as required by 24 CFR part 
92 and 25 Cal. Code of Regulations, Section 8218(a) (2) no later than ninety (90) days after 
the end of each fiscal year as established for the Development pursuant to Section 18(a) of 
this Agreement. The report shall contain a certification by Borrower as to such information 
as City may then require including, but not limited to the following: 

a.  The fiscal condition of the Development, including a financial statement for the 
previous fiscal year that includes a balance sheet and a profit and loss statement

Packet Page 130 of 498Borrower shall operate the Development in accordance with the approved annual

published annual Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, Residential Rent for All 
Urban Consumers for the West (CPI) shall be deemed approved by City. In the 
event this particular CPI index is no longer published, City shall select a similar 
index for this purpose. 

e.  Borrower  shall  operate  the  Development  in  accordance  with  the  First-Year 
Operating Budget approved by and on file with City. Such budget shall show all 
anticipated  income,  debt  service  and  expenses  for  management,  operations, 
reserves and maintenance for the first fiscal year or portion thereof following initial 
occupancy. 

23. Required Reserves. 

a.  Commencing  no  later  than  the  end  of  the  second  month  following  the  initial 
occupancy of the Development or such other date, as City shall designate in writing, 
Borrower  shall  establish  a  segregated  interest-bearing  Replacement  Reserve 
account in an F.D.I.C. or other comparable federally insured financial institution. 
Borrower shall make monthly deposits from Operating Income to the Replacement 
Reserve account in amounts as specified in the approved Initial Year Operating 
Budget and subsequent annual budgets. Initially, the annual deposit shall be Twelve 
Thousand Dollars and No Cents ($12,000.00) based on $500 per unit per year, or 
such other amount as approved by City in the Initial Year Operating Budget. City 
may review the adequacy of these monthly deposits on an annual basis, and require 
adjustments, as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at a date that is 
five (5) years from the Effective Date of this Agreement and every five (5) years 
thereafter, and at the request of City, Borrower shall engage the services of a third- 
party professional to prepare a physical needs assessment of the replacement needs 
of the Development. The annual deposit to the Replacement Reserve account shall 
be adjusted based upon the results of the physical needs assessment report. The cost 
for the report shall be an eligible expense from the Replacement Reserve account. 
Withdrawals are subject to approval by City and the Department and shall only be 
made for capital improvements, such as replacing or repairing structural elements, 
furniture, fixtures or equipment of the Development that are reasonably required to 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 131 of 498preserve  the  Development.  The  annual  deposit  required  under  the  Replacement 
Reserve  and  Security  Agreement  executed  in  connection  with  Borrower’s 
permanent financing is deemed to have satisfied the requirements under this Section 
so  long  as  the  annual  deposit  required  thereunder  is  consistent  with  the 
requirements herein. 

b.  Upon  receipt  of  the  fourth  installment  of  capital  contribution  from  Borrower’s 
investor limited partner (as such installment is made pursuant to the terms of the 
Partnership  Agreement),  Borrower  shall  establish  and  fully  fund  an  operating 
reserve account in the amount of Thirty-Seven Thousand Seven Hundred Eighty- 
Eight Dollars and No Cents ($37,788.00) (the “Operating Reserve”). The Operating 
Reserve accounts shall be held in an F.D.I.C. or other comparable federally insured 
financial institution. Any funds remaining in the Operating Reserve at the end of 
the Compliance Period shall be released to the Borrower and applied in accordance 
with Section 25(b)(2) hereof to the extent necessary to enable the Borrower to fully 
pay any Deferred Developer Fee (and accrued interest thereon) outstanding at such 
time. Any balance remaining shall continue to be retained by Borrower following 
the end of the Compliance Period and used in accordance with this Section 23(b). 
Requests  for  withdrawal  from  the  Operating  Reserve  must  be  approved  or 
disapproved by City within sixty (60) days of receipt of written request. A written 
withdrawal request that is not disapproved within sixty (60) days of receipt shall be 
deemed approved. Borrower may make monthly deposits from project income in 
the priority set forth in the Partnership Agreement to replenish withdrawals from 
the  Operating  Reserve  in  order  to  restore  the  balance  therein  to  the  Operating 
Reserve Amount (As defined in the Partnership Agreement). 

c.  Any reserves shall be the property of the Development and may not be distributed 
nor  taken  from  the  Development  when  it  is  sold  or  the  limited  partnership 
composition changes. 

d.  City shall, at its sole discretion, require verification that the Operating Reserve is 
funded pursuant to the above Section 23(b) prior to release of the final ten percent 
(10%) of the total amount of HOME funds, pursuant to Section 3.B. of the HOME 
Standard Agreement Exhibit B. 

24. Accounting Records.  In a manner subject to City approval, Borrower shall maintain on an 
accrual  or  modified  accrual  basis,  a  general  ledger  accounting  system  that  is  posted 
monthly and that accurately and fully shows all assets, liabilities, income and expenses of 
the Development. All records and books relating to this system shall be kept for a period 
of at least seven (7) years and in such a manner as to ensure that the records are reasonably 
protected from destruction or tampering. All records shall be subject to City inspection and 
audit.

proportional basis.

Borrower  is  in  default  of  its  obligations  under  this  Agreement  or  the  HOME 
Program requirements.

be subject to such terms and conditions as may be necessary to preserve or establish 
the  Fiscal  Integrity  of  the  Development  and  to  ensure  compliance  with  HOME 
Program  requirements  and  this  Agreement.  Such  conditions  may  include  the

Development and use the same and the reserve funds for the operation and 
maintenance of the Development.

amount in full, City may proceed with a foreclosure in accordance with the 
provisions of the Deed of Trust and State law regarding foreclosures. 

However, in the event of a nonmonetary breach which cannot reasonable be 
cured within the time period set forth in such notice, the HOME Loan may 
not be accelerated hereunder if within said designated time period Borrower 
or any of Borrower’s limited partners has given written notice to City of 
Borrower’s  intention  to  cure  said  breach,  has  commenced  to  cure  such 
breach and has diligently prosecuted and effected such cure which shall be 
completed no later than sixty (60) days from the date notice of such breach 
is given. 

5)  City make seek such other remedies as may be available under law. 

b.  In the event that the breach or violation involves the rents to tenants or other charges 
in excess of those permitted under this Agreement, City may demand, and seek as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Packet Page 137 of 498an additional remedy, the return of such excess rents or other charge to the affected 
household. 

c.  The remedies of City hereunder are cumulative, and the exercise of one or more of 
such remedies shall not be deemed an election of remedies and shall not preclude 
the exercise by City of any one or more of its other remedies. 

d.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any cure of any default or Event 
of Default made or tendered by a limited partner of Borrower shall be deemed to 
be a cure by Borrower and shall be accepted or rejected on the same basis as if 
made or tendered by Borrower. Copies of all notices which are sent to Borrower 
under  the  terms  of  this  Agreement  shall  also  be  sent  to  Borrower’s  managing 
general partner and Borrower’s limited partner(s) as defined in Section 41. 

32. Assignment of City Rights.  City retains the right, at its sole discretion, to assign all or part 
of its rights under this Agreement for the purpose of ensuring compliance and enforcement 
of Borrower’s duties and obligations hereunder. In addition, City may designate an agent 
to act on its behalf in monitoring compliance and enforcing the provisions hereof. 

33. Amendment.  This Agreement shall not be altered or amended except in writing, executed 

between the Parties. 

34. Partial  Invalidity.  If  any  provision  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  invalid,  illegal  or 
unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof 
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 

35. Binding on Successors.  This Agreement shall bind, and the benefits thereof shall inure to, 
the  respective  parties  hereto,  their  legal  representatives,  executors,  administrators, 
successors in the office of interest, and assigns, provided, however, that Borrower may not 
assign this Agreement or any of its obligations hereunder, voluntarily or by operation of 
law, without the prior written approval of City and the Department. 

36. Recording Agreement.  This Agreement, and all amendments thereto, shall be executed by 
each of the Parties. This Agreement, or memorandum thereof, shall be recorded against the 
subject Property in the Official Records of Sutter County. 

37. Hold Harmless.  Borrower and its successors in interest agree to indemnify, defend, and 
hold  harmless  City  and  its  respective  agents,  employees  and  officers  from  any  and  all 
claims, losses, liabilities or causes of actions (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising 
from  or  in  connection  with  Borrower’s  management,  maintenance  or  operation  of  the 
Development.

of any sums by Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Note would result in the 
payment of interest which would exceed the amount that City may legally charge 
under  the  laws  of  the  State  of  California,  then  the  amount  by  which  payments 
exceed the lawful interest rate shall automatically be deducted from the principal 
balance owing on this Note, so that in no event shall Borrower be obligated under 
the terms of the Note to pay any interest which would exceed the lawful rate.

immediately  due  and  payable  upon  written  notice  by  City  to  Borrower  without 
further demand. 

c.  The failure to exercise the remedy set forth in Subsection 7 b. above or any other 
remedy provided by law upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events 
of default shall not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise any remedy at any

to do so or is otherwise in default hereunder, Trustee or Beneficiary, or both, may appear 
in said action or proceeding and retain counsel therein and defend the same, or otherwise 
take such action therein as they or either of them may deem advisable, and may settle or 
compromise the same or the said adverse claim; and in that behalf, and for any of the said 
purposes, may pay and expend such sums of money as they, or either of them may deem 
to be reasonable and necessary. 

 
6.  To comply with all laws, ordinances, regulations, covenants, conditions and restrictions 
affecting said Development, and not to suffer or permit any act to be done in or upon said 
Development  in  violation  thereof,  including,  as  applicable,  but  not  limited  to  Sections 
92.252 and 92.254 of the Code of Federal Regulations Title 24 (24 CFR Part 92), including, 
without limitation, the repayment of the HOME Loan balance upon request of Beneficiary 
in the event that Trustor loses possession of the Property. 

 
7.  That, if Trustor fails to do so, Beneficiary without demand or notice and as in its  sole 
judgment  it  may  consider  necessary,  may  do  any  or  all  such  other  and  further  things 
required  of  Trustor  by  any  of  the  provisions  herein  contained  and  incur  and  pay  all 
reasonable and necessary expenses in connection therewith, which amounts shall become 
an additional obligation of Trustor secured by this Deed of Trust. 

 
8.  To pay to Trustee and Beneficiary, respectively, promptly and within thirty (30) days of 
receipt of written demand, the amounts of all sums of money which they shall respectively 
pay  pursuant  to  any  of  the  provisions  herein  contained,  including  but  not  limited  to 
reasonable  attorneys’  fees  and  the  cost  of  evidence  of  title  or  any  guarantee  thereof, 
together with interest upon each of said amounts, until repaid, from the time of the payment 
thereof, at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum. 

 
9.  That  upon  default  by  Trustor  in  payment  of  any  indebtedness  secured  hereby  or  in 
performance  of  any  material  agreement  hereunder  after  any  applicable  cure  periods, 
Beneficiary may deliver a written Notice of Default (as set forth in the Agreement) and of 
election to cause said Property to be sold, which notice Trustee shall cause to be filed for 
record, and Beneficiary may also declare all sums secured hereby immediately due and 
payable by delivery to Trustee of written declaration of default. After the lapse of such 
time as may then be required by law following the recordation of said Notice of Default, 
and Notice of Sale having been given as then required by law, Trustee, without demand on 

 

Packet Page 158 of 498Trustor, shall sell said Property at the time and place fixed by it in said Notice of Sale, 
either as a whole or in separate parcels, and in such order as Beneficiary may determine, 
subject to any statutory right which Trustor may have to direct such order, at public auction 
to the highest bidder for cash in lawful money of the United States, payable at time of sale. 
Trustee may postpone sale of all or any portion of said Property by public announcement 
at such time and place of sale, and from time to time thereafter may postpone such sale by 
public  announcement  at  the  time  fixed  by  the  preceding  postponement.  Trustee  shall 
deliver to such purchaser its deed conveying the Property so sold, but without any covenant 
or warranty, express or implied. The recitals in such deed of any matters or facts shall be 
conclusive  proof  of  the  truthfulness  thereof.  Any  person,  including  Trustor,  Trustee  or 
Beneficiary may  purchase  at  such  sale.  After  deducting  all  costs,  fees  and  expenses  of 
Trustee and of this Trust, including cost of evidence of title in connection with sale, Trustee 
shall apply the proceeds of sale to payment of: all sums expended under the terms hereof, 
not then repaid, with accrued interest at five percent (5%) per annum; all other sums then 
secured hereby; and the remainder, if any, to the person or persons legally entitled thereto. 

 
10. That all of the rents, issues and profits of said Property are hereby assigned to Beneficiary 
as further security for the payment of the indebtedness and performance of the obligations, 
covenants, promises and agreements secured hereby. Provided, and only for so long as, 
Trustor  is  not  in  default  hereunder,  Beneficiary  hereby  authorizes  Trustor  or  Trustor’s 
agents to collect the aforesaid rents and revenues. In case default be made in payment of 
any indebtedness secured hereby or in performance of any of Trustor’s material agreements 
herein  contained,  Beneficiary  shall  be  entitled  at  any  time  without  notice,  in  its  sole 
discretion, either by their agents attorneys, employees, or by a receiver to be appointed by 
a court, and without regard to the adequacy of any security for the indebtedness hereby 
secured, to enter upon and take possession of the above Property or any part thereof, and 
to do and perform any acts that Beneficiary may deem necessary or property to conserve 
the value thereof, and to collect and receive all rents, issues and profits thereof, including 
those past due and agrees that Beneficiary may also take possession of, and use, any and 
all personal property contained in said Property and used by Trustor in the rental or leasing 
of said Development or any part thereof. Beneficiary may apply all such rents, issues and 
profits  collected  or  received  by  it  in  the  manner  hereinabove  specified  in  respect  of 
proceeds of sale of said Property, or any part of all of such moneys may be released by 
Beneficiary  at  its  sole  option.  The  expense  (including  receivers’  fees,  if  any,  and 
compensation to any agent appointed by Beneficiary, and reasonable counsel fees and costs 
and disbursements) incurred in taking possession and effect collection, shall be deemed a 
portion of the expense of this trust to be paid by Trustor and secured hereby. Neither the 
entering upon and taking possession of the said Property nor the collection of such rents, 
issues and profits and the application or release thereof as aforesaid, shall cure or waive 
any default or Notice of Default hereunder or invalidate any act done pursuant to such 
Notice. 

 
11. That all judgements, awards of damages and settlements, hereafter made as a result of or 
in lieu of any condemnation or other proceedings for public use of, or for any damage to, 

 

Packet Page 159 of 498said Property or the improvements and any award for change of grade of streets thereon 
are hereby assigned and shall be paid to Beneficiary. Trustor agrees to execute such further 
assignments of any such award, judgment or settlement as Beneficiary may require, and to 
deliver to Beneficiary all proceeds of any such award, judgment or settlement which may 
be  received  by  Trustor.  Beneficiary  is  authorized  and  empowered  (but  not  required)  to 
collect and receive any funds and is authorized to apply them in whole or in part upon any 
obligation or indebtedness secured hereby, in such order and manner as Beneficiary shall 
determine at its sole option. Application of all or any part of the funds so collected and 
received by Beneficiary or the release thereof shall not cure or waive any default under this 
Deed of Trust. The rights of Beneficiary under this Section 11 are subject to rights of any 
senior mortgage lender. 

 
12. Without affecting the liability of Trustor or any other person (except any person expressly 
released in writing) for payment of any indebtedness secured hereby or for performance of 
any  obligation  contained  herein,  and  without  affecting  the  rights  of  Beneficiary  with 
respect to any security not expressly released in writing, Beneficiary may, at any time and 
from time to time, either before or after the maturity of the Note, and without notice or 
consent: 

Release any person liable for payment of all or any part of the indebtedness, or 
for performance of any obligation; 

Make  any  agreement  extending  the  time  or  otherwise  altering  the  terms  of 
payment  of all or any part of the indebtedness, or modifying or waiving any 
obligation,  or  subordinating, modifying or otherwise dealing with the lien or 
charge hereof; 

Exercise or refrain from exercising or waive any right Beneficiary may have; 

Accept additional security of any kind; 

Release  or  otherwise  deal  with  any  Development,  real  or  personal,  securing 
the  indebtedness, including all or any part of the Development herein described. 

 
13. That  if  the  indebtedness  secured  hereby  is  now  or  hereafter  further  secured  by  chattel 
mortgages,  security  interest  deeds  of  trust,  pledges,  contracts  of  guaranty  or  other 
additional  securities,  Beneficiary  may,  at  its  option,  exhaust  any  one  or  more  of  said 
securities as well as the security hereunder, either concurrently or independently and in 
such order as it may determine, and may apply the proceeds received upon the indebtedness 
secured hereby without affecting the status of, or waiving any right to exhaust all or any 
other security including the Security hereunder and without waiving any breach or default 
of any right or power, whether exercised hereunder or contained herein, or in any such 
other security.

Packet Page 160 of 49814. This Deed of Trust shall not construed to create a security interest under the provisions of 
the Uniform Commercial Code, as same together with any amendments or supplements 
thereto may be in effect, with respect to any goods, equipment, appliances, bank accounts, 
account receivables, inventory or articles of personal property now attached to or used or 
hereafter to be attached to or used in connection with the Development. 

 
15. That  acceptance  by  Beneficiary  of  any  sum  in  payment,  or  part  payment,  of  any 
indebtedness secured hereby, after the same is due or after the recording of a Notice of 
Default, shall not constitute a waiver of the right to require prompt payment, when due, of 
all other sums so secured, nor shall such acceptance cure or waive any remaining default 
or  invalidate  any  sale  held  pursuant  to  such  Notice  for  any  such  remaining  default,  or 
prejudice any of the rights of Beneficiary under this Deed of Trust. 

 
16. That Beneficiary may, at any time Beneficiary may desire, appoint another Trustee in the 
place and stead of said Trustee or any successor in trust, and the title herein conveyed to 
said Trustee shall be vested in said successor, which appointment shall be in writing and 
shall be duly recorded in the Recorder’s Office of Sutter County. 

 
17. That the trusts herein created are irrevocable. 
 
18. That  default  under  the  terms  of  any  instrument  evidencing  and  debt  secured  by  an 
encumbrance senior or prior to this instrument shall, after the expiration of any applicable 
cure periods, constitute a default hereunder. 

 
19. That  upon  the  request  of  Trustor  or  Trustor’s  successors  in  ownership  of  the  land, 
Beneficiary may hereafter, at its option, at any time before full payment of the indebtedness 
secured hereby, make further advances to Trustor or said successors in ownership, and the 
same, with interest and late charges, if any, shall be secured by this Deed of Trust; provided, 
that if Beneficiary, at its option, shall make a further advance or advances as aforesaid, 
Trustor or said successors in ownership agree, upon request of Beneficiary, to execute and 
deliver to Beneficiary a note to evidence the same, payable on or before that maturity of 
the indebtedness secured hereby and bearing such other terms as Beneficiary shall require. 

 
20. That default in the terms of the City Loan Agreement and the Regulatory Agreement and 
any  other  instrument  securing  the  debt  secured  hereby  shall,  after  expiration  of  any 
applicable cure periods, constitute a default in this Deed of Trust. 

 
21. That the invalidity of any one or more covenants, phrases, clauses, sentences or paragraphs 
of this Deed of Trust shall not affect the remaining portions of this Deed of Trust or any 
part thereof and this Deed of Trust shall be construed as if such invalid covenants, phrases, 
clauses, sentences or paragraphs, if any, had not been inserted herein. 

 
22. Trustor agrees to pay Beneficiary’s charges for the preparation of any financial or loan 
statements regarding the obligations secured by this Deed of Trust requested by Trustor or 

 

Packet Page 161 of 498on its behalf. 

 

 
23. If the Property is income property, Trustor, at the request of Beneficiary, shall deliver to 
Beneficiary  Trustor’s  signed copies of  all  leases,  or  executed  counterparts  thereof,  now 
existing  or  hereafter  made  affecting  all  or  any  part  of  the  Property.  Trustor  shall  not, 
without  Beneficiary’s  written  consent  (which  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld  or 
delayed), permit an assignment of any lease or request or consent to the subordination of 
any lease of all or any part of the Property to any lien subordinate to this Deed of Trust. If 
Trustor becomes aware that any tenant proposes to do, or is doing, any act or thing which 
may give rise to any right of set-off against rent, Trustor shall, subject to any limitations in 
§42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if applicable: (i) take such steps as 
shall be reasonably calculated to prevent the accrual of any right to a set-off against rent, 
and (ii) take such steps as shall effectively discharge such set-off and as shall effectively 
assure that rents thereafter due shall continue to be payable without set-off or deduction. 
Upon Beneficiary’s taking possession of the Property by receiver or otherwise, Trustor 
shall be deemed to have assigned to Beneficiary all leases now existing or hereafter made 
of all or any part of the Property and all leases now existing or hereafter made of all or any 
part of the Property and all security deposits made by tenants in connection with such leases 
now existing or hereafter made by tenants in connection with such leases of the Property 
for so long as Beneficiary remains in possession; thereupon, Beneficiary shall have all of 
the rights and powers possessed by Trustor prior thereto and Beneficiary shall have the 
right  to  modify,  extend  or  terminate  such  existing  leases  and  to  execute  new  leases,  in 
Beneficiary’s reasonable determination. 

 
24. If Trustor shall voluntarily file a petition under the Federal Bankruptcy Act, as such Act 
may  from  time  to  time  be  amended,  or  under  any  similar  successor  Federal  statute 
relating  to  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  arrangements  or  reorganizations,  or  under  any  state 
bankruptcy or  insolvency  act,  or  file  an  answer  in  an involuntary  proceeding  admitting 
insolvency or inability to pay debts, or if Trustor shall fail to obtain a vacation or stay of 
involuntary  proceedings  brought  for  the  reorganization,  dissolution  or  liquidation  of 
Trustor  within  sixty  (60)  days  from  the  date  when  such  proceedings  are  brought,  or  if 
Trustor  shall  be  adjudged bankrupt,  or  if  a  trustee  or  receiver  shall  be  appointed  for 
Trustor or Trustor’s Property, of if the Property shall become subject to the jurisdiction of 
a Federal bankruptcy court or similar state court, or if Trustor shall make an assignment 
for the benefit of Trustor’s creditors, or if there is an attachment, execution or other judicial 
seizure of any portion of Trustor’s assets and such seizure is not discharged within thirty 
(30) days, then Beneficiary may, at Beneficiary’s option, declare all of the sums secured 
by this Deed of Trust to be immediately due and payable without prior notice to Trustor, 
and Beneficiary may invoke any remedies permitted by this Deed of Trust. Any reasonable 
attorneys’ fees and other reasonable expenses incurred by Beneficiary in connection with 
Trustor’s bankruptcy or any of the other aforesaid events shall be additional indebtedness 
of Trustor secured by this Deed of Trust. 

 
25. Should Trustor sell, convey, transfer or dispose of the Property, or any part thereof, or any 

 

 

Packet Page 162 of 498interest therein, or place any lien or encumbrance thereon subordinate to the lien created 
hereby, or agree to do so (whether voluntarily or by any operation of law), without the 
written consent of Beneficiary being first obtained, except as permitted in the Agreement, 
Beneficiary shall have the right, at its option, to declare all sums secured hereby forthwith 
due and payable. This option may be exercised at any time after the occurrence of such 
event and the acceptance of one or more installments from any person thereafter shall not 
constitute a waiver of Beneficiary’s option. Consent to one such transaction shall not be 
deemed  to  be  a  waiver  of  the  right  to  require  such  consent  to  future  or  successive 
transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary hereinabove, the respective interests 
of  the  Borrower’s  limited  partners  shall  be  transferrable  without  the  consent  of  the 
Beneficiary. Moreover, the limited partners of Trustor shall be permitted to remove and 
replace one or more general partners but only in accordance with the terms of the Loan 
Agreement. 

 
26. Notwithstanding  the  existence  of  any  other  security  interest(s)  in  the  Security  held  by 
Beneficiary or by any other party, Beneficiary shall have the right to determine the order 
in  which  any  or  all  of  the  Security  shall  be  subjected  to  the  remedies  provided  herein. 
Beneficiary shall have the right to determine the order in which any or all portions of the 
indebtedness secured hereby are satisfied from the proceeds realized upon the exercise of 
the remedies provided herein. Trustor, any party who consents to this Deed of Trust and 
any party who now or hereafter acquires a security interest in the Security, or any part 
thereof, and who has actual or constructive notice hereof, hereby waives any and all rights 
to require the marshaling of assets in connection with the exercise of any of the remedies 
permitted by applicable law or provided herein. 

 
27. Casualty: 
 

 

 

a.  Definitions.  For purposes of this Section 27, the following terms and phrases shall 

have the meanings indicated: 

i.  “Restoration”  means  the restoration, repair,  replacement  or  rebuilding of  the 
Property and/or the Development to a value, condition and character equal  to 
or  greater  than  that  immediately  prior  to  the  damage,  destruction  or 
“Taking”, as defined below. 

 
ii.  “Taking”  means  the  taking  of  all  or  any  part  of  the  Property  and/or  the 
Development, or any interest therein or right accruing thereto, as the result of 
the exercise of the right of condemnation or eminent domain, or change of grade 
affecting the Property or the Development, or any part thereof. A  conveyance 
in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of any such right of condemnation or 
eminent domain shall be considered a Taking. 

b.  Repair.  In case of any damage to the Property or the Development, or any part 
thereof, if the reasonable cost of Restoration (any temporary repairs and protection 

 

Packet Page 163 of 498pending commencement of the Restoration) exceeds Fifty Thousand Dollars and 
No Cents ($50,000.00), Trustor will promptly give written notice of such damage 
to Beneficiary, describing the nature and extent of such damage and setting forth 
the  best  estimate  of  the  cost  of  Restoration  (and  such  temporary  repairs  and 
protection). In case of any damage to the Property or the Development, or any part 
thereof,  Trustor  at  its  expense  shall  promptly  commence  and  complete  the 
Restoration provided that the Net Casualty Insurance Proceeds (defined below) are 
made available to Trustor. All insurance proceeds on account of any damage to the 
Property and/or Development shall be payable to, and deposited with, Beneficiary. 
Subject to the conditions set forth below, Beneficiary shall request from Trustor the 
estimate of  cost of Restoration, which Restoration shall be accomplished by the 
Trustor  if  Beneficiary  receives  satisfactory  guarantees  from  Trustor  that  when 
combined with the insurance proceeds held by Beneficiary, the Restoration can be 
accomplished  such  that  the  value  of  Beneficiary's  lien  is  not  impaired.  If 
Restoration as provided herein is not determined by Beneficiary to be available due 
to insufficient funds and/or lack of adequate guaranties and prompt action by the 
Trustor, Beneficiary, at its sole option, (i) may apply such insurance proceeds upon 
the  Note,  as  the  Beneficiary  may  determine,  (ii)  may  release  such  insurance 
proceeds, without reducing the principal balance of the Note, to Trustor, or (iii) 
may divide any such amount in any manner among any such application, use or 
release.  No  such  application,  use  or  release  shall,  however,  cure  or  waive  any 
default under the Agreement or invalidate any act done pursuant to a Notice of 
Default.  Any  unapplied,  undisbursed  insurance  proceeds  remaining  with  the 
Beneficiary shall inure to the benefit of and pass to the owner or purchaser of the 
Property or any part of it at any foreclosure or trustee’s sale under the Agreement. 

c.  Application.  In the event that Trustor requests that the insurance proceeds be used 
to accomplish the Restoration, then any “Net Casualty Insurance Proceeds” (i.e., 
the casualty insurance proceeds remaining after reimbursement of the Beneficiary 
for  any  reasonable  costs  and  expenses  of  the  Beneficiary,  including  reasonable 
attorneys’ fees, for collection thereof) received by the Beneficiary shall be applied 
to the cost of Restoration and disbursed in the same manner and subject to the same 
conditions as the Project Funds (as defined in the Agreement) but only if each of the 
following  conditions  is  satisfied:  (A)  no  default  or  potential  default  exists 
hereunder; (B) the Net Casualty Insurance Proceeds, together with such  additional 
funds  (the  “Required  Equity  Funds”)  as  Trustor  shall  have  deposited  with  the 
Beneficiary  (and  which  the  Trustor  shall  be  required  to  deposit  with  the 
Beneficiary  within  one  hundred  twenty  (120)  days  after  the  occurrence  of  such 
casualty), are sufficient, in the reasonable judgment of the Beneficiary, to pay all 
costs of (1) the Restoration and (2) interest under the Note and any other expenses 
related to the Development; (C) the anticipated date for completion of Restoration 
shall, in the reasonable judgment of the Beneficiary, be prior to the date which is 
six (6) months prior to the then-applicable maturity date of the Note; and (D) each 
of the insurance companies from which the Net Casualty Insurance Proceeds are 

 

 

Packet Page 164 of 498received  shall  have  waived  in  writing  all  right  of  subrogation  for  the  benefit  of 
Trustor and the Beneficiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the value of 
Beneficiary’s lien is unimpaired, the Net Casualty Insurance Proceeds shall be used 
for Restoration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 27(c) shall be subject 
to the terms of the Subordination Agreement. 

 
28. Condemnation.  Subject  to  the  terms  of  the  Subordination Agreement,  in  the  event  of  a 
partial Taking such that the Development is subject to Restoration, all proceeds and awards 
shall be paid to Beneficiary to accomplish the Restoration in the event that Trustor requests 
and satisfies the conditions for the same; and such amount shall be disbursed as set forth 
in  Section  27(c)  (as  the  same  applies  to  the  application  of  the  Net  Casualty  Insurance 
Proceeds, with each reference therein to insurance proceeds deemed to include a reference 
to  condemnation  proceeds  and  awards).  In  the  event  of  a  total  Taking  or  in  the  event 
Borrower does not elect to apply such award or proceeds to the Restoration, such amount 
shall be applied as follows, in the order of priority indicated: 

a.  To  reimburse  Beneficiary  for  all  reasonable  costs  and  expenses,  including 
reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with collecting such proceeds; 

 

 
b.  To the payment of the accrued and unpaid interest on the Note; 
 
c.  To the payment of the unpaid principal of the Note; and 
 
d.  Any remaining balance, to the Trustor. 

 
29. Cure by Limited Partner.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any cure of any 
default  or  Event  of  Default  made  or  tendered  by  a  limited  partner  of  Borrower  (or  an 
affiliate thereof) shall be deemed to be a cure by Borrower and shall be accepted or rejected 
on the same basis as if made or tendered by Borrower. Copies of all notices which are sent 
to Borrower under the terms of this Agreement shall also be sent to Borrower’s limited 
partners. 

 
30. Superiority of Regulatory Agreement.  Borrower covenants that it has not, and shall not, 
enter into or execute any other agreement with provisions contrary to the provisions of the 
Regulatory  Agreement  or  contrary  to  the  intent  of  maintaining  the  affordability  of  the 
Property for the full Period of Affordability. The HOME Regulatory Agreement is superior 
to this Deed of Trust. 

 
UPON WRITTEN REQUEST OF BENEFICIARY stating that all sums secured hereby 
have  been  paid,  and  upon  surrender  of  this  Deed  of  Trust  and  the  Note  to  Trustee  for 
cancellation  and  retention  and  upon  payment  by  Trustor  of  its  fees,  Trustee  shall  reconvey, 
without  warranty,  the  estate  in  the  Property  then  held  by  Trustee.  The  grantee  in  such 
reconveyance  may  be  designated  and  described  as  the  “person  or  persons  legally  entitled 

 

Packet Page 165 of 498thereto”, or by other appropriate terms. 

This  Deed  of  Trust  shall  inure  to  and  bind  the  heirs,  legatees,  devisees,  administrators, 
executors, successors and assigns of the parties hereto, and shall be so construed that wherever 
applicable  with  reference  to  any  of  the  parties  hereto,  the  use  of  the  singular  number  shall 
include the plural number, the use of the plural number shall include the singular number, the  use 
of  the  masculine  gender  shall  include  the  feminine  gender,  and shall  likewise  be  so construed 
as applicable to and including a corporation or corporations that may be a party or  parties hereto. 
The term Beneficiary shall mean the owner and holder of the Note secured  hereby, whether or 
not named as Beneficiary herein. 

TRUSTOR hereby requests that a copy of any Notice of Default and of any Notice of Sale 
hereunder be mailed to it, as well as the limited partner(s) as the addresses hereinbefore set forth:

the state that existed prior to such installation, maintenance, repair or replacement. 

It is understood and agreed that grades, grading and drainage may be changed on 
the Parcels in connection with construction of the LOPA II Development and the 
AMG Development.  Each Parcel is hereby burdened with the obligation to accept

drainage water from the other Parcels and each Parcel is hereby granted the right 
to  install  and  maintain  drainage  and  grading  improvements  on  its  Parcel 
consistent with construction plans approved by the City of Live Oak.  

Drainage pond(s) on a parcel of land comprising a portion of the LOPA I Property 
shall be available to accept storm water from the other Properties. It is specifically 
understood and agreed that the LOPA II Property is burdened with the obligation 
to accept such drainage water from the other Parcels and that the other Parcels are 
granted  the  right  to  install  and  maintain  additional  drainage  and  grading 
improvements  on  the  LOPA  I  Property  sufficient  to  accept  storm  and  drainage 
water from their respective developments.   

Cost, Maintenance, Operation and Repair Obligations and Rights.  The Owner of 
each  Parcel  or  its  designee  shall  be  responsible  for  operating,  maintaining  and 
repairing  the  landscaping,  improvement,  roads,  Common  Facilities  and  Utility 
Facilities  located  on  its  respective  Parcel  and  shall  keep  its  Parcel  well 
maintained, in good repair and condition and reasonably free of trash and debris.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that Utility Facilities located on one 
Owner’s Parcel benefit only the other Owner’s Parcel, such Utility Facilities shall 
be operated, maintained and repaired by the benefitted Owner. Each Owner shall 
have the right to establish reasonable and non-discriminatory rules regarding the 
use of the Common Facilities on its Parcel. 

Subject to the terms below regarding the Shared Expenses, all costs of operation, 
maintenance and repair of the LOPA I Property and LOPA I Development shall 
be borne exclusively by LOPA I; all costs of operation, maintenance and repair of 
the LOPA II Property and LOPA II Development shall be borne exclusively by 
LOPA II; and all costs of operation, maintenance and repair of the AMG Property 
and AMG Development shall be borne exclusively by AMG or its designee.  All 
utilities shall be separately metered for each Parcel.   

Notwithstanding the foregoing,  each Owner shall pay its proportionate  share of 
the  cost  of  operating,  maintaining,  restoring  and  using  Common  Facilities  and 
Utility Facilities used in common (the "Shared Expenses").  Such proportionate 
share shall be based on the number of residential rental units on each Parcel that 
have,  as  of  the  date  of  accrual  of  the  relevant  cost,  receive  certificates  of 
occupancy  from  the  City  of  Live  Oak  (the  “Prorata  Share”).    However,  in  the 
event that the LOPA II Property or the AMG Property are ultimately developed 
with  anything  other  than  affordable  multifamily  housing  (an  “Incompatible 
Development”), the Prorata Share of the LOPA II Owner (if developed with an 
Incompatible  Development)  and/or  the  AMG  Owner  (if  developed  with  an 
Incompatible  Development)  shall  be  deemed 
to  be  21.5%  and  28.5%, 
respectively, for all purposes herein.   
On or before August 1st of each year commencing the first August 1st following 
either  the  LOPA  II  Development  or  the  AMG  Development  receiving  at  least 
some  certificates  of  occupancy,  the  apartment  management  company  managing 

 

 

Packet Page 182 of 498 

the  developments  shall  prepare  and  circulate  to  Owners  a  budget  setting  forth 
anticipated  Shared  Expenses  for  the  following  year  (a  “Shared  Expenses 
Budget”).  On or before September 1st of each year, Owners shall each approve 
the relevant Shared Expenses Budget in writing.  If the Owners cannot agree on a 
Shared Expenses Budget, the dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration in 
Live Oak, California before an arbitrator selected from a list maintained by the 
Judicial  Arbitration  and  Mediation  Services  (“JAMS”).    If  the  matter  must 
proceed to arbitration, such dispute shall be decided by an arbitrator to be chosen 
by the  Owners or, if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then assigned by 
JAMS.  The Owners, or any of them, shall serve each Owner and JAMS a demand 
for Arbitration within three business days of September 1st if no Shared Expenses 
Budget has been approved.  Such arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to JAMS 
Comprehensive  Arbitration  Rules  and  Procedures  and  in  accordance  with  the 
Expedited  Procedures  in  those  Rules  (and  shall  be  decided  within  30  days  of 
submission of the dispute to JAMS) and shall be mandatory and the judgment of 
the  arbitrator  shall  be  final.    Except  in  the  case  of  an  emergency,  neither  the 
apartment management company nor any Owner shall incur any Shared Expenses 
in  excess  of  the  Shared  Expenses  Budget  without  the  written  consent  of  both 
Owners. 

Each  Owner  may  send  written  notice  to  the  other  Owner(s)  from  time  to  time 
requesting  that  Owner  to  pay  its  respective  Prorata  Share  of  Shared  Expenses, 
provided that statements therefor shall be sent no more frequently than once each 
month.  Each Owner shall pay, within fifteen (15) days of delivery of any such 
written  notice,  its  Prorata  Share  of  such  Shared  Expenses.    Such  notice  shall 
include an itemized statement, with supporting evidence in the form of invoices, 
receipts, or other evidence of the nature of the expenses incurred, of all expenses 
incurred  by  the  Owner  seeking  payment  in  operating,  maintaining,  repairing 
and/or replacing the Common Facilities.  
 
In the  event that any Owner of a Parcel fails to fulfill its obligations under the 
terms  of  this  Agreement  (a  "Non-Performing  Owner"),  including,  without 
limitation,  performance  of  maintenance  and  repair  of  the  Common  Facilities  or 
Utility Facilities, then upon ten (10) days' written notice from any Owner of any 
other Parcel (a "Performing Owner"), such Performing Owner may perform any 
such obligations of the Non-Performing Owner in accordance with the terms and 
standards of this Agreement at the sole cost and expense of the Non-Performing 
Owner.  Upon delivery of written notice of the cost and expense of completing 
such  obligations,  including  an  itemized  statement  thereof  with  supporting 
evidence in the form of invoices, receipts, or other evidence of the nature of the 
expenses  incurred,  such  Non-Performing  Owner  shall  immediately  pay  to  the 
Performing  Owner  the  full  amount  of  such  costs  and  expenses,  together  with 
interest  from  the  date  the  Performing  Owner  incurs  such  costs  and  expenses 
through the date of payment by the Non-Performing Owner at the rate of 6% per 
annum.    In  collecting  such  costs,  expenses  and  interest  due,  Performing  Owner 
shall have all rights and remedies provided by law, including, without limitation, the right 
to file a lien against the Non-Performing Owner’s Parcel.

Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  herein,  nothing  contained 
herein shall obligate any Owner to construct any new improvement on any other 
Owner's Parcel (or to directly or indirectly pay to such other Owner any amount 
on account of any such new improvement on such other Owner's Parcel).  

Insurance.  

Until such time as building permits are received for construction of improvements 
on the LOPA II Property and/or the AMG Property, LOPA I shall, at LOPA I’s sole 
cost and expense, maintain in full force and effect with respect to all of the Parcels: 
Commercial general liability insurance written on an occurrence basis, with limits 
of  at  least  $1,000,000  per  person  per  accident  and  at  least  $1,000,000  property 
damage, or Combined Single Limit of at least $2,000,000 consisting of both bodily 
injury  and  property  damage  coverage.  Thereafter,  each  Owner  that  has  received 
building permits (or its designee) shall, at their sole cost and expense, maintain in 
full force and effect with respect to their respective Parcels: Commercial general 
liability insurance written on an occurrence basis, with limits of at least $1,000,000 
per  person  per  accident  and  at  least  $1,000,000  property  damage,  or  Combined 
Single Limit of at least $2,000,000 consisting of both bodily injury and property 
damage coverage. 

Each Owner of a Parcel required to carry insurance as set forth above shall cause 
the  Owners  of  the  other  Parcels  to  be  named  as  additional  insureds  under  its 
respective commercial general liability policy.   

At least annually and upon renewal, each Owner required to be insured under this 
paragraph shall furnish the other Owner with certified copies of all such policies 
and with valid certificates of insurance for all of such policies showing the carriers, 
policy numbers, names of additional insureds and expiration dates.  

Eminent Domain.  Nothing herein shall be construed to give any Owner any interest in 
any award or payment made to any other Owner, as the owner of its respective Parcel, in 
connection with any exercise of the power of eminent domain, or transfer in lieu thereof, 
affecting  any  portion  of  a  Parcel,  even  though  the  affected  portion  of  such  Parcel  is 
encumbered by the easement rights herein granted; however, each Owner shall have the 
right to make a separate claim against any condemning authority for any diminution in 
value of its Parcel on account of the loss of use of the easement rights herein granted and 
for the value of any improvements installed by such Owner pursuant to said easement 
rights which are damaged or destroyed in connection with any exercise of the power of 
eminent domain or any transfer in lieu thereof.   

Attorneys' Fees.  In the event any Owner shall be in default under this Agreement, or if 
any  dispute  shall  arise  between  any  Owners  concerning  the  interpretation  of  this 
Agreement, and if an action shall be brought in connection therewith in which it shall be 
finally (with no further appeal being available due to the expiration of appeal periods or 
otherwise) determined that any Owner was in default, or that the court agrees with one 
Owner’s  interpretation  of  the  disputed  provision  of  this  Agreement,  the  Owner 

 

 

 

Packet Page 184 of 498determined by the court to be in default, or with whose interpretation of this Agreement 
the court does not agree, shall pay to the other Owner(s) all reasonable attorneys' fees and 
litigation expenses incurred or paid by the other Owner(s) in connection therewith. 

General Standard of Use and Maintenance.  The Owner of each Parcel shall exercise its 
rights hereunder so as not to materially interfere with the normal use of the other Parcels 
and the rights of the other Owners, shall not construct or place any obstacle or otherwise 
interfere in any way with the use of the easements herein granted by any other parties 
entitled  to  the  use  and  enjoyment  of  them  as  described  herein,  and  shall  maintain  the 
easement facilities located on its Parcel in a condition and appearance consistent with the 
integrated operation and appearance of the Parcels.  Each of the Owners shall have the 
right in its sole  discretion,  to  relocate, remove  or  alter the  surface of  or  any  structure, 
improvement or facility located on its Parcel, provided that such relocation, removal or 
alteration  does  not  materially  interfere  with  the  rights  granted  hereunder  to  any  other 
Owner. 

Covenants Run with the Land.  All of the easements, restrictions and obligations herein 
shall create servitudes running with the title to the Parcels herein described.  The benefits 
and burdens under this Agreement are not personal but shall run with the title to their 
respective Parcels and shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Owners 
and their respective successors and assigns as owners of the Parcels.  In the event of sale 
of all or any residential units within the Parcels, the purchaser shall be responsible for 
carrying out the obligations set forth herein and, in the event less than all of one Owner’s 
residential units are sold or transferred, the purchaser’s prorata share shall be determined 
in the same manner set forth above in Section 5.   

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in the event that any Parcel shall 
cease to be used for residential purposes (a “Non-Residential Parcel”) then all easements 
and  rights  granted  to  such  Non-Residential  Parcel  with  respect  to  parking,  common 
amenities  and  Common  Facilities  shall  be  canceled  and  vacated  and  all  obligations  of 
such  Non-Residential  Parcel  to  contribute  to  the  payment  of  Shared  Expenses  to  the 
extent they relate to parking, common amenities and Common Facilities shall cease.  The 
Owners expressly agree that they shall execute and record a vacation of all rights and 
duties granted to a Non-Residential Parcel under this Agreement which relate to parking, 
common amenities and Common Facilities.  

Notices.  All notices, requests, demands, consents and other communications required or 
permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly 
and properly given on the date of service if delivered via hand delivery, or on the first 
business  day  following  deposit  with  a  nationally  recognized  overnight  courier  service 
(e.g. FedEx), postage prepaid, in any event addressed appropriately as follows:

Attn: Alexis Gevorgian 

Any Owner may change its address for purposes of this Section 11 by giving the other  
Owners written notice of the new address in the manner set forth above. 

Co-Management.    Owners  agree  that,  during  any  time  during  which  more  than 
one of the Developments is being operated as an affordable housing development, 
they  shall  utilize  the  same  management  company  to  manage  their  respective 
Developments.    The  common  management  agent  shall  enter  into  separate 
contracts with each Owner and bill for services separately.   

In the event of a  dispute between the Owners  as to what management agent to 
select  at  any  given  time  or  as  to  whether  an  acting  management  agent  shall  be 
terminated,  such  dispute  shall  be  decided  by  an  arbitrator  to  be  chosen  by  the 
Owners or, if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then assigned by JAMS.  
Such arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration 
Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those 
Rules (and shall be decided within 60 days of submission of the dispute to JAMS) 
and shall be mandatory and the judgment of the arbitrator shall be final. 

Construction  Licenses.  Each  Owner  grants  the  other  Owners  and  their  employees, 
agents, contractors, guests and invitees, the right, privilege and license to use its Parcel 
for purposes of storing construction materials and equipment and for parking and office 
use while construction of the construction of the Developments is in progress.  All such 
use shall be at no cost to the Owner making such use.  

The method of use of the Parcels under this license shall be as follows:  
The  Parcels  shall  be  used  in  an  orderly  and  workmanlike  manner  and  without  undue 
interruption to the construction of the Development being constructed on the Parcel being 
made use of.  The Owner making use of the other Owner’s Parcel will indemnify and 
hold  the  other  Owner  and  its  officers,  agents,  contractors,  principals  and  employees 

 

Packet Page 186 of 498harmless  for  any  liability  arising  out  of  the  use  the  other  Owner’s  Parcel;  and,  in 
exercising  the  License,  the  Owner  making  use  must  use  reasonable  care  and  may  not 
unreasonably increase the burden on the Parcel being used. Owners retain the right to use 
their Parcels in any manner not inconsistent with the license herein granted. 

The license shall be for so long as is reasonably necessary to complete construction of the 
above-mentioned Developments.   

 
14.  Mortgagee Protection. 
 
 

(a) 

Agreement  Superior  to  Mortgage.  This  Agreement,  and  the  easements, 
covenants and restrictions contained herein shall at all times be superior to the lien of any deed 
of  trust,  mortgage,  security  agreement  or  other  monetary  lien  or  encumbrance  that  may  exist 
against the Parcels as of, or any time after, the date of this Agreement (together, a “Mortgage”).  
Each  party,  upon  the  written  request  of  the  other  party,  shall  obtain  written  recordable 
agreements from its lenders and other holders of such liens, if any, whereby such lienor agrees to 
subordinate their interests under such liens to the rights and interests of the parties created by this 
Agreement.  As used herein, the term “Mortgagee” or “mortgagee” shall mean the mortgagee, 
beneficiary or secured party under any Mortgage.  

(b) 

Effect of Breach. No breach or violation of any term or provision hereof 
by any Owner shall defeat, render invalid, extinguish, modify or otherwise affect the lien of any 
deed of trust or mortgage now or hereafter encumbering all or any part of such Owner's Parcel 
(and upon foreclosure of any such deed of trust or mortgage, the purchaser at such foreclosure 
sale shall take the Parcel free of any lien or obligation arising with respect to any such breach or 
default by such Owner). 

(c) 

Notices.  Any  default  notices  provided  for  in  this  Agreement  shall  also  be 
provided to the holder of any mortgage or deed of trust and such other party or parties related to an Owner 
which have delivered a copy of a notice to each party requesting a copy of such notices.  

(d) 

Cure Right. Any mortgagee or limited partner of any Owner shall have the right 
but not the obligation within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a notice, to cure any default, or if such 
default  (other  than  the  payment  of  money)  cannot  be  cured  within  thirty  (30)  days,  to  diligently 
commence curing within such time and complete the cure thereof within a reasonable period thereafter. 

(e) 

Limitation of Liability. The liability of any Mortgagee for obligations under this 
Agreement, whether before or after foreclosure, shall be limited solely to its interest in the Development 
to which it encumbers and the proceeds received upon execution of judgment against such party’s interest 
in such Development, and neither such entity nor any partner, officer, shareholder or member of such 
entity shall be personally liable for any deficiency in the payment of any judgment. No other property or 
assets of such entity shall be subject to execution or other enforcement procedure for the satisfaction of a 
judgment or other judicial process.  

(f) 

No Amendment Without First Mortgagee Consent. This Agreement shall not be 
amended without the prior written consent of any first Mortgagee holding a valid first mortgage or deed 
of trust with respect to one or more of the Parcels, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or 
delayed.  
 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

Packet Page 187 of 49815.  Miscellaneous. 
 

(a) 

This Agreement may not be amended or modified orally but may be amended or 
modified only in writing, signed by all of the parties hereto (or their respective 
successors or assigns as Owners) and approved in writing by the limited partners 
of Owners to the extent applicable (the “Limited Partners”).  No waiver of any 
term  or  provision  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  effective  unless  it  is  in  writing, 
making specific reference to this Agreement and signed by the Parties and the 
Limited Partners, and any such waiver shall not constitute a waiver of any other 
or subsequent rights under or violations of this Agreement. 

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with 
respect to the subject matter hereof.  This Agreement shall be binding upon the 
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and shall inure to the 
benefit of each of them. 

This Agreement has been executed and delivered in and shall be governed by and 
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California. 

If  any  term  or  provision  of  this  Agreement  shall  be  held  invalid,  illegal  or 
unenforceable, in  whole  or  in  part, the  validity  of any  and  all  other  terms  and 
provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected thereby. 

The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only 
and are not part of this Agreement and shall not be used in construing it. 

This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which, when 
taken together, shall constitute an original. 

This Agreement may be enforced in a California court of law or equity in any 
manner provided by law or in this Agreement, including, without limitation, any 
action  for  specific  performance  or  damages,  and  any  failure  by  any  party  to 
enforce any provision of this Agreement shall in no event be deemed a waiver of 
the right to do so thereafter.  

Nothing contained herein shall be construed as creating any rights in the general 
public or as dedicating for public use any portion of the Parcels, Common Area 
Facilities  or  Utility  Facilities,  it  being  the  intent  of  the  Owners  that  this 
Agreement shall be strictly limited to and for the purposes herein expressed. No 
easements,  except  those  expressly  set  forth  herein,  shall  be  implied  by  this 
Agreement. 

Nothing contained herein shall be construed to make the Owners partners or joint 
venturers, or to render either of the Owners liable for the debts or obligations of 
the other Owner.  

This Agreement shall be recorded in the County Recorder’s Office of the County 
of Sutter, California and Owners shall share the expense of recordation.

Packet Page 188 of 498Each Owner shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify, defend, and 
hold harmless the other Owner, its officers, partners, officials, employees, agents 
and contractors from and against any claims or damages arising out of an Owner’
s performance or failure to comply with the obligations under this Agreement, for 
its negligent or willful acts or omissions or in connection with its exercise of any 
easement or license granted hereunder. 

An “Event of Default” shall occur under this Agreement in the event there is a 
breach of any provision, condition, covenant, warranty, promise or representation 
contained in this Agreement, and such breach continues for a period of thirty (30) 
days after written notice thereof to the defaulting party, the limited partners of 
Owners  and  to  any  lenders  of  Owner  that  have  provided  Owners  with  notice 
information  (“Parties  With  Cure  Rights”)  without  the  defaulting  party  or  other 
Parties With Cure Rights curing such breach; provided, however, if such default 
is of the nature requiring more than 30 days to cure, the defaulting Party shall 
avoid default hereunder by commencing to cure within such 30 day period, and 
thereafter diligently pursuing such cure to completion within an additional sixty 
(60) days following the conclusion of such 30 day period (for a total of ninety 
(90)  days).    Except  as  required  to  protect  against  further  damages,  the  injured 
Owner may not institute proceedings against the Owner in default until the time 
for cure has expired.  Failure or delay in giving such notice shall not constitute a 
waiver of any default, nor shall it change the time of default.  Furthermore, each 
Owner agrees that, in the case of a default by the other Owner, the non-defaulting 
Owner shall give notice of such default to all Parties With Cure Rights and that 
any such party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure the default and 
the  non-defaulting  Owner  agrees  to  accept  cure  from  any  of  the  Parties  With 
Cure Rights to the same extent as it would be obligated to accept cure from the 
defaulting Owner.  

Nothing  contained  herein  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  gift  or  dedication  of  any 
portion  of  the  LOPA  I  Property,  LOPA  II  Property  or  AMG  Property  for  the 
benefit of the general public or for any public purposes whatsoever, it being the 
intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement shall be strictly limited to the 
purposes herein expressed. 

Owners acknowledge and ratify the terms of that certain Storm Drainage 
and  Detention  and  Pedestrian  Access  Easement  and  Maintenance 
Agreement dated November 10, 2015 and recorded in the Records of the 
County  of  Sutter  on  November  23,  2015  as  document  number  2015-
0017041 (the “Easement Agreement”).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in 
the  event  of  a  conflict  between  the  Easement  Agreement  and  this 
Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail as between the parties hereto.
