PUBLIC HEARING 

5. 

Public Hearing to receive public comment on the City's intent to close Grant 13-
CDBG-8970 

Administrator Eckert and Beckie Flores of the Regional Housing Authority reviewed the staff 
report, stated the purpose of the grant and answered questions of Council. The grant amount 
was $900,000 and was used to assist 6 low income first time homebuyers and 3 housing rehab 
projects. The City is required to hold a public hearing to discuss the grant accomplishments and 
submit a closeout certification to the State 

The public hearing was opened and seeing no one present wishing to speak, the hearing was 
closed.

6. 

Public Hearing and Resolution to consider 1.) Expenditure of Program Income 
Funding and Request to CDBG for Program Income Waivers and 2.) City Council 
changes to Impact Fees 

Administrator Eckert addressed Council explaining the expenditure request, where the funds 
would come from and the benefit to the City. The City currently has a CDBG Program Income 
balance of $415,709. All funds need to be expended prior to accessing any future grant funds 
awarded by CDBG. The City has reviewed a proposed 32-unit senior housing development. This 
project is requesting use of the CDBG Program Income for land acquisition and public 
infrastructure improvements, both of which are eligible activities under the CDBG program. In 
addition, a vital consideration in the competitive review by the State is City participation by 
means of funding. Staff recommended the City "participate" by reducing the impact fees for this 
project by 25%. 

The public hearing was opened and seeing no one present wishing to speak, the hearing was 
closed.
