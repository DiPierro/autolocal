Recommendation 
City staff respectfully recommends that the City Council appoint Rukhsana Khan and Sumran 
Khan to fill the Planning Commissioner seat vacancies. 
Background 
The recent appointment of Zachary Torres to City Council and the resignation of Bob Wise on June 10th 
created two partial term vacancies on the Planning Commission.  The partial terms will expire on 
January 1, 2022.  The Planning Commission is comprised of the following members: 
 
Commissioner   
 
Vacant   
Vacant   
 
 
Maria Espino 
Ishrat Khan  
 
Kenneth Wolfe   
 
In keeping with the Council’s direction at the May 20th Council meeting, staff advertised the Planning 
Commission vacancies and utilized an application and letter of interest process.   Three applications 
were received prior to the deadline on June 14, 2019; however, one applicant withdrew on July 1, 2019.  
 
City Council can take action to either appoint two new Commissioners to fill the partial terms or 
direct staff to re-advertise for a greater pool of applicants.  If appointed, the new 
Commissioner’s terms will start at the next Planning Commission meeting following Council 
appointment. 
 
Financial Impact - None  
 
Compliance with City Council Strategic Plan or Budget Goals  
The City Council and City staff are committed to providing effective leadership while providing

Staff Report

Mayor and City Council 
Paul Eckert, City Administrator 
Approval of Letter to Butte County Board of Supervisors Opposing Hemp Farm 

X  Regular  
 
Special 
  Closed

Recommendation 
City staff respectfully recommends that the City Council approve the attached letter to the Butte County 
Board of Supervisors opposing the Hemp Farm adjacent to Gridley. 
Background 
The City recently observed a new large Hemp Farm immediately adjacent to the Gridley City limit.  We 
have confirmed that the Butte County Agricultural Commissioner approved the Hemp Farm without any 
preestablished formal policy and regulation and without notification to the City of Gridley and our area 
residents.  The attached letter to the Board of Supervisors outlines the City’s concerns on behalf of our 
area residents and businesses and requests that the Board halt the Hemp Farm operation.  It’s very 
disappointing that with over 1,073,280 acres in Butte County that the Agricultural Commissioner 
approved a site immediately adjacent to our City. 
 
We have very serious concerns regarding the Butte County Agriculture Commissioner’s recent approval 
of a very large Hemp Growing operation immediately adjacent to nearly one-third of Gridley’s 
residential housing units and at our northerly Highway 99 entrance that welcomes visitors and business 
prospects to our community.  It appears that the Agricultural Commissioner acted with apparent 
negligence in permitting the Hemp Farm at the Deniz Ranch and in doing so, demonstrated a total 
disregard of our Gridley residents and business community.  
 
The Agricultural Commissioner’s negligence seems abundantly clear as his actions are in stark contrast 
to the County Board of Supervisors previously developed stringent policies, including provisions to 
restrict odors as it relates to the growing of marijuana.  Having spent hundreds of staff and elected 
hours and tens of thousands of dollars on the subject, the County is well aware that hemp and 
marijuana have nearly identical odor characteristics.  The Agricultural Commissioner failed to address 
the odor and other concerns while approving the Hemp Farm immediately adjacent to thousands of 
Gridley residents, including the large Heron Landing residential community, the Ford Avenue 
Apartments as well as Orchard Hospital and their senior housing, and less than a half mile away from 
our High School. 
  
Communities similarly impacted have been forced to take expensive legal action and to adopt costly 
Odor Control Ordinances to confront the adverse impacts of similar Hemp operations.  Making matters 
worse, almost all of the Hemp operations in the other surveyed communities are in fact much smaller 
than the nearly 100-acre Hemp operation in Gridley that Butte County approved without any 
consultation with impacted residents. 
 

Residents from those other communities’ report that the subsequent negative impact of the Hemp 
operations have factually reduced their property values and significantly diminished their quality of life.  
While “dead skunk” is the most common term used when describing the smell, the strong odor 
permeates clothing, buildings, and vehicles and can travel great distances.   Imagine 100,000 skunks 
spraying next to your home.  Reportedly, the smell becomes so obnoxious that many residents can’t go 
outside.  
 
Worse yet, school officials in other communities have shared that “Many staff, students, and families 
have significant concerns about noxious odor during the harvest season and its adverse impact on the 
health of the students and the staff.”  Other community residents have indicated that “for months, the 
intense, skunk-like, eye-watering stench prevented us from opening our windows and doors to cool our 
houses on summer nights, raising nighttime temperatures to unhealthy levels and causing sleep 
deprivation and anxiety.”   
 
Financial Impact - None  
 
Compliance with City Council Strategic Plan or Budget Goals  
The City Council and City staff are committed to providing the highest possible quality of life to our 
residents as well as effective leadership while providing quality cost effective local government services.

Butte County Board of Supervisors 
25 County Center Drive, Suite 200 
Oroville, CA 95965 

We are looking to you for your help. We have very serious concerns regarding the Butte County 
Agriculture Commissioner's recent approval of a very large Hemp Growing operation immediately 
adjacent to nearly one-third of Gridley's residential housing units and at our northerly Highway 99 
entrance that welcomes visitors and business prospects to our community. It appears that the 
Agricultural Commissioner acted with apparent negligence in permitting the Hemp Farm at the Deniz 
Ranch and in doing so, demonstrated a total disregard of our Gridley residents and business community. 

On behalf of our residents and business community, the City of Gridley respectfully requests that the 
Butte County Board of Supervisors take action to halt the Hemp Farm operation with the potential of 
100,000 plants immediately adjacent to the Gridley community. 

The Agricultural Commissioner's negligence seems abundantly clear as his actions are in stark contrast 
to the County Board of Supervisors previously developed stringent policies, including provisions to 
restrict odors as it relates to the growing of marijuana. Having spent hundreds of staff and elected 
hours and tens of thousands of dollars on the subject, the County is well aware that hemp and 
marijuana have nearly identical odor characteristics. The Agricultural Commissioner failed to address 
the odor and other concerns while approving the Hemp Farm immediately adjacent to thousands of 
Gridley residents, including the large Heron Landing residential community, the Ford Avenue 
Apartments as well as Orchard Hospital and their senior housing. 

Communities similarly impacted have been forced to take expensive legal action and to adopt costly 
Odor Control Ordinances to confront the adverse impacts of similar Hemp operations. Making matters 
worse, almost all of the Hemp operations in the other surveyed communities are in fact much smaller 
than the nearly 100-acre Hemp operation in Gridley that Butte County approved without any 
consultation with impacted residents. 

Residents from those other communities report that the subsequent negative impact of the Hemp 
operations have factually reduced their property values and significantly diminished their quality of life. 
While "dead skunk" is the most common term used when describing the smell, the strong odor 
permeates clothing, buildings, and vehicles and can travel great distances. Imagine 100,000 skunks 
spraying next to your home. Reportedly, the smell becomes so obnoxious that many residents can't go 
outside. 

Worse yet, school officials in other communities have shared that "Many staff, students, and families 
have significant concerns about noxious odor during the harvest season and its adverse impact on the

health of the students and the staff." Other community residents have indicated that "for months, the 
intense, skunk-like, eye-watering stench prevented us from opening our windows and doors to cool our 
houses on summer nights, raising nighttime temperatures to unhealthy levels and causing sleep 
deprivation and anxiety." Regrettably, the City has received indication that our residents may pursue 
legal action against Butte County. 

On behalf of our Gridley residents and business community, the Gridley City Council respectfully appeal 
to you for help. We ask that the Board halt the Hemp operation at the Deniz Ranch site. We also 
respectfully request that the Board of Supervisors agendize the Gridley Hemp Farm and formally notify 
all Gridley residents regarding the date and time of the Board of Supervisors' Meeting. 

Thank you for your leadership in resolving this matter on behalf of our shared constituents in the Gridley 
area.
