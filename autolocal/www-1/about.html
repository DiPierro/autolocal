      CityCouncilor is a tool to help journalists track and discover public meetings across city governments.
      To sign up, journalists can enter keywords (eg. homelessness, wildfires, etc.) and geographic locations of interest, and CityCouncilor will send an email alert whenever an upcoming meeting agenda with relevant information comes up.
