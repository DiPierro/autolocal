      CityCouncilor is a tool to help journalists track and discover public meetings across city governments.
      To sign up, journalists can enter keywords (eg. homelessness, wildfires, etc.) and geographic locations of interest, and CityCouncilor will send an email alert whenever a document with relevant information comes up. 

      CityCouncilor is a project created out of Stanford University's Exploring Computational Journalism course. The creators of this project are Chris Stock, Erin Bennett, Holden Foreman, and Patricia Wei. They are advised by Stanford professors RB Brenner, Krishna Bharat, Maneesh Agrawala, and Cheryl Phillips.
